I'm going to be asking you to write a letter to Brian Sheperd the President of MTNA . 
The purpose of the New Mexico , interventing if possible 
 the tone of the letter should be similar to the tone 
 of HR listing a series of complaints against an employee
 the background is that Chip is declaring the environment to be hostile, just 
   as an employee would seek protection from HR against a hostile employee

Hi Brian,

The is a followup and a request for a meeting with you. During that meeting I wish to 
A) Establish a sanity check with someone outside of New Mexico regarding the work environment I have been in during the past year as Vice President. I have more tasks to do as VP and would appreciate guidance.
B) I wish to share with you the evolution of the website, specifically a resource library that I have created, allowing members to connect online, sharing teaching resources and contact information. This project has given me joy, particularly its AI-driven lists capabilities, which have given me hours of study into new topics.



 The issues are (chronologically)



 > Chip Miller requested the membership list from Jeanne Grealish on [date]; Jeanne Grealish replied [x].
 > Chip Miller requested a copy of the handbook on [date]. JR responded it was online, despite the former webmaster's (Larry Blind)'s email [cite]
 > Chip Miller obtained a copy of the handbook from Ferrell Robers [ciite] on [date] and made it available on the website on [date]. 
 > Chip Miller send a copy of the existing online membership to Jeanne Grealish on [date]; JG responded that it was out of date and incorrect . Chip asked for a corrected version. She did not send one.
 > Chip Miller requested a copy of financials on [date] to Jeanne Grealish. She responded [x]. He asked again on [date] and has not received a response. The overview report in the board meeting was not detailed in accordance with the handbook [cite]
> Chip Miller was asked to report during the board meeting on membership status without having received a membership list. Janna also stated that she had no membership list [cite]. 
> Chip Miller submitted a teacher of the year nomination to JR on [date] and JR responded a confirmation [cite]. In the board meeting JG attempted to nullify the submission three times, asserting that the submission was for the previous year. JG slandered the teacher of the year nomineees saying "how little she has contributed." However, the nominee was named to other board members and immediately seconded with confirmations of contribution.
> Chip Miller sent out an email to the membership in an appeal for the Foundation [cite]; JR responded with    . 

> Presonal reflections
The intervening time between requesting a copy of the handbook , and actually not receiving one except through Ferrell Roberts , is bewildering. 
How the secretery can claim that resources have been online, and simply not distribute the handbook at a request, is bewildering.
How the secretery can claim that online material (membership list) is out of date and not send a corrected list at a request, is bewildering.
How the secretery can attempt to thwart a nomination is bewildering.
How the secretery can ignore a request for financial information is bewildering.
How the secretery is getting paid is bewildering. 

There have been no minutes dispered since the last board meeting (Spring [date needed]) . The handbook states 60 days [cite]

Were this a place of employment, I would have left long ago. Awareness of my ability to provide some service of value to my fellow teachers has been the driving force in keeping me here.

I am truly excited about the resources section of the website and the potential it has to connect us together in a wholesome manner, becoming resources not just for ourselves in New Mexico, but available immediately to others online in their own musical journeys. I wish to focus on that now.
