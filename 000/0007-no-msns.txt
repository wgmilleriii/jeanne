**Subject: URGENT GOVERNANCE CONCERNS: Necessity of Fiduciary Compliance and Review of Ethical Conflicts for November 7–8 Board Meeting**

Dear Sharon and Members of the PMTNM Board of Directors,

I am writing in response to the latest planning communications regarding the November 7–8 Board Meeting, including the inquiry about using **Larry Blind’s school/Berna Facco facility**. While I appreciate the effort to secure a venue, I must formally assert that the procedural and ethical breaches currently facing PMTNM render the convening of the Board Meeting and subsequent budget approval profoundly problematic unless three material conflicts are immediately addressed.

### I. Lack of Fiduciary Oversight Invalidates Board Action

Holding a Board Meeting to approve the annual budget without mandatory oversight compliance constitutes a **material breach of fiduciary duty** that exposes the organization and its officers to risk.

*   **Budget Committee Failure:** The PMTNM Bylaws require the Budget Committee to **"prepare a budget for the coming year and present the budget to the Board for approval at the Conference Board Meeting"**. Despite the Conference being four weeks away, the committee has not met, and the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST) stated that **"There probably will be no need for an actual meeting"**.
*   **Denial of Access:** My requests for **"full financial details per handbook guidelines"** required for the budget process have been rejected. The refusal to provide an elected officer with documentation directly required for the **November 7–8 Conference** means any budgetary approval is procedurally unsound.

Proceeding with the meeting while ignoring these time-sensitive financial mandates undermines the authority of the Board itself.

### II. Unresolved Ethical Concerns Regarding Meeting Venue

The ethical history surrounding the **New Mexico School of Music (NMSM)** and its principals raises severe conflict of interest concerns regarding the proposed meeting venue.

*   **Documented Ethical Dispute:** Larry Blind, a principal associated with the NMSM and involved in conference planning, was previously implicated in an ethical dispute. I informed MTNA CEO Brian Shepard that Larry Blind and Tatiana Vetrinskaya's refusal to participate in the transfer of a student, accompanied by Larry's perceived **"rude and unprofessional manner in his refusal to speak with me"**, caused me to file an **"open complaint of violation of the MTNA code of ethics"**.
*   **Conflict of Trust:** The utilization of facilities connected to individuals and an institution involved in unresolved documented ethical concerns creates an environment of distrust and undermines the professional standards PMTNM is meant to uphold.

I request the Board immediately review the appropriateness of conducting official business and elections within a facility tied to individuals involved in these documented ethical disputes.

### III. Alienation of Albuquerque Teachers through Aggressive Advertising

Compounding the ethical conflicts is the ongoing financial and reputational harm caused by the very entity connected to the proposed meeting location.

*   **Harm to Community Standing:** PMTNM is already suffering from membership decline and low engagement. I previously noted that our organization is **"barely populated"** (less than 15% membership) in Albuquerque.
*   **Direct Financial Threat:** This failure is worsened by local businesses, implicitly the New Mexico School of Music, advertising as **"#1 Music Faculty for all Instruments and Voice in Albuquerque, New Mexico"**. I calculated the loss of revenue from students attracted by such advertising to be substantial, representing a **"potential loss of 50 members from this community"**.
*   **Lack of Trust:** Hosting the mandatory Board Meeting at a facility associated with the same aggressive advertising practices that **"further alienate Albuquerque teachers"** is counterproductive to our mission to build trust and professional community engagement.

### IV. Remote Access Requirement and Secret Ballot Procedure

To ensure statewide participation and equitable access regardless of the physical venue, meetings must be administered with official remote access.

*   **Zoom Administration:** Regardless of the facility ultimately chosen, all Board and committee meetings shall be officially administered by Zoom (or an equivalent videoconferencing platform) so members across the state can fully participate. As reflected in prior correspondence, Albuquerque members are **"not willing to travel"** (Sharon), underscoring the necessity of a guaranteed remote‑access modality.
*   **Secret Ballot Oversight via Email:** All secret ballots shall be administered via email with an oversight distribution that includes:
    -   The President
    -   The Vice President
    -   The Executive Secretary‑Treasurer (EST)
    -   One Board member
    -   One member‑at‑large

This process ensures integrity, accountability, and timely verification of results while protecting voter anonymity.

### Formal Board Agenda Request

Pursuant to **Article VIII, Section 5 of the PMTNM Bylaws**, I formally request that the Board of Directors address the entirety of these governance and ethical concerns at the November 7–8 meeting. Immediate action is required to ensure that our organization operates with transparency and adherence to MTNA ethical standards.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
