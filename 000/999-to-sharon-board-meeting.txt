Subject: ITEMS FOR BOARD AGENDA (November 7–8): Financial Compliance, Governance Standardization,  Secretarial Conduct Review, Meeting Modality

Dear President Kunitz,

I am writing to formally request the inclusion of five critical resolutions on the agenda for the upcoming November 7–8 Board Meeting. These measures are necessary to resolve systemic failures in governance and administration that directly undermine PMTNM’s financial compliance and procedural integrity. The urgency stems from the imminent Conference deadlines, particularly the budget approval and officer transition.

1. Officer Access to Financial Records
The Budget Committee must fulfill its mandated role of budget preparation. This requires immediate access to essential organizational documents, which has been systematically denied.
Resolution Mandate: The Board shall mandate the immediate and continuous access for the Vice President and all required officers to PMTNM’s comprehensive financial documentation. This handbook states in Section VI the EST "F. Keeps up-to-date, itemized and accurate financial transactions in a computerized accounting program. Pays by check all authorized expenditures and keeps the checkbook balanced. Maintains and provides reports on special PMTNM funds. O. Has the financial records, CPA's reports, check book, receipts, and vouchers available prior to the conference for inspection by the Auditing Committee.  The records should be open to any member at all times." 

The statements that the EST made in the spring board meeting, "if anytime anybody wants to see the books, they're there, they're available. The accountant's annual report was mailed to the finance committee" are contrary to my repeated requests for financial information; I have never received the financial information that the EST claimed was available or mailed.


Supporting Rationale:
• Fiduciary Violation: As Vice President, I am required by the Handbook to "Serve as a member of the Budget Planning Committee" and assist in the "preparation and/or approval of the budget".
• Systematic Obstruction: When financial information was requested on March 17, 2025, the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST) responded that the VP role "does its work in August and has no function beyond that".
• Invalid Budget Process: Despite my explicit inquiry on October 2, 2025, asking "Shall we convene a budget committee? I do not think we have met yet", the EST responded that "There probably will be no need for an actual meeting". This attempted unilateral negation of a mandated committee process jeopardizes the validity of the budget to be voted on in November.
• Lack of Transparency: It is bewildering that the secretary can ignore a request for financial information when the Handbook requires records be open to any member at all times.

2. Resolution Establishing Mandatory Minimum Handbook Requirements
The Board must establish binding deadlines to enforce procedural stability and prevent the continuous administrative chaos related to documentation and reporting.
Resolution Mandate: The Board shall formally adopt and enforce mandatory deadlines for core administrative processes, confirming the authority of the Handbook.
• Minutes Distribution Outstanding: As of October 9, 2025, the EST stated that "Board reports will be requested on November first, compiled and sent to current Board along with spring Minutes". This confirms that the spring Minutes have not yet been distributed, potentially violating the required timely circulation documented in the Handbook.


3. Vote of No Confidence — Executive Secretary‑Treasurer (EST)
The EST’s documented pattern of dismissing mandated processes and consistently obstructing officer duties requires formal Board review. The totality of these actions severely impairs governance and warrants a Vote of No Confidence.
Resolution Mandate: Place a motion for a Vote of No Confidence regarding the continued service of the Executive Secretary-Treasurer, Jeanne Grealish, on the agenda, with supporting documentation circulated in advance.
Documented Conduct and Organizational Risk:
• Repudiation of Governance: The EST stated that the Handbook is "grossly out of date" and that PMTNM "does not function under any legal mandates!". This public dismissal of regulatory compliance to a non-profit organization poses an immediate Organizational Risk to PMTNM’s standing. PMTNM IS a 501(c)(3) organization (tax-exempt status granted 1981, currently in force). Operating as a 501(c)(3) does impose legal mandates regarding governance, financial transparency, and fiduciary duties.
• General Documentation Failure: I experienced a prolonged gap between requesting the Handbook (January 9, 2025) and receiving a copy from the EST (July 13, 2025). I was able to obtain a copy from another member on March 8, 2025 only by driving across the state; significant time was lost since my election as VP in November 2024. The EST claimed the handbook was online, contrary to the previous President's statements that the handbook had not been put online.
• Systematic Obstruction and Scorn: The EST has demonstrated a clear pattern of discouraging required committee processes and minimizing the Vice President’s role by asserting the VP role had "no function beyond" August. Furthermore, the EST has issued hostile communications toward the VP, including labeling mandated Foundation communications as "Boring and irrelevant" and dismissing VP facility-research efforts as "useless".
• Interference in Award and Succession: The EST has attempted to derail both the Teacher of the Year nomination (by repeatedly declaring the Teacher of the Year nomination as "last year", questioning the documentation, and the nominee's community service) and the VP selection process.
• Nominating Committee Integrity: The EST inappropriately suggested to the President that if a new VP is not on the slate, "why not have Laura choose someone she’d like to work with even if that person has not served on the Board?". This circumvents the formal role of the Nominating Committee, which is explicitly led by the Immediate Past President. The Board must affirm proper succession procedure.
• Accountability of Compensation: The EST is an appointed position receiving financial compensation. Given the administrative failures, the EST's continuation in this role is problematic.

4. Zoom as Official Meeting Modality (Physical Secondary)
To ensure statewide participation and quorum regardless of venue, the Board must adopt Zoom (or equivalent) as the official modality for all Board and committee meetings, with any physical location expressly secondary.
Resolution Mandate: Establish Zoom as the official meeting platform for all PMTNM Board and committee meetings; any in‑person option must be concurrent and secondary.
Supporting Rationale: In prior correspondence, the President noted that members in Albuquerque "won't even drive 2 miles to the event!!". A guaranteed remote‑access modality removes barriers to participation, ensures transparency, and supports equitable access across the state.

5. Secret Ballot Procedure via Email Distribution (Integrity and Oversight)
To ensure verifiable and secure secret ballots without reliance on a single administrator, ballots shall be submitted via email by the voting member to a dedicated distribution list for safekeeping and audit.
Resolution Mandate: Establish and publish a Ballot Oversight Distribution List including: the President, the Vice President, one designated Board member, and one designated Member‑at‑Large. For each secret ballot, members shall email their vote to this distribution address; messages will be retained for reconciliation and audit by the listed officers.
Supporting Rationale: Recent patterns of administrative opacity by the EST—denial of timely access to financial documents, obstruction and delay in distributing the Handbook, and attempts to thwart the 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination after acknowledging receipt—demonstrate the need for multi‑party oversight. A distribution‑based process protects voter anonymity while ensuring records exist beyond a single administrator’s control.

I formally request that these five resolutions be honored and placed on the agenda for the November Board meeting to ensure procedural integrity and accountability before officer installation and budget approval.
Sincerely,
Chip Miller Vice President, PMTNM
