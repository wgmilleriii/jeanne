Subject: ITEMS FOR BOARD AGENDA (Nov 7–8): Financial Compliance, Governance Standards, Meeting Modality, EST Review

Dear President Kunitz,

I respectfully request inclusion of five agenda items for the November 7–8 Board Meeting. These items are intended to address gaps in governance and administration and to support PMTNM’s financial compliance and procedural integrity. The urgency stems from the imminent Conference deadlines, particularly the budget approval and officer transition.

Pursuant to the PMTNM Handbook, Article VIII (Board of Directors), Section 5:
“Any member in good standing with a concern about the operation of the PMTNM organization may contact the President and request in writing to have his/her concern put on the next Board of Directors meeting agenda and be invited to speak at the meeting to present his/her concerns to the Board of Directors.”

1. Officer Access to Financial Records
The Budget Committee must fulfill its mandated role of budget preparation. This requires timely access to essential organizational documents, which I have not yet received despite requests.
Resolution Mandate: The Board shall mandate the immediate and continuous access for the Vice President and all required officers to PMTNM’s comprehensive financial documentation. This handbook states in Section VI the EST "F. Keeps up-to-date, itemized and accurate financial transactions in a computerized accounting program. Pays by check all authorized expenditures and keeps the checkbook balanced. Maintains and provides reports on special PMTNM funds. O. Has the financial records, CPA's reports, check book, receipts, and vouchers available prior to the conference for inspection by the Auditing Committee.  The records should be open to any member at all times." 

At the spring board meeting, it was stated, "if anytime anybody wants to see the books, they're there, they're available. The accountant's annual report was mailed to the finance committee." Respectfully, I note that I have not yet received the referenced financial information.


Supporting Rationale:
• Fiduciary Violation: As Vice President, I am required by the Handbook to "Serve as a member of the Budget Planning Committee" and assist in the "preparation and/or approval of the budget".
• Statement regarding VP role: When financial information was requested on March 17, 2025, the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST) responded that the VP role "does its work in August and has no function beyond that".
• Budget Committee meeting: Despite my explicit inquiry on October 2, 2025, asking "Shall we convene a budget committee? I do not think we have met yet", the EST responded that "There probably will be no need for an actual meeting." Such an approach would bypass a mandated committee process and risk the validity of the budget to be voted on in November.
• Lack of Transparency: It is bewildering that the secretary can ignore a request for financial information when the Handbook requires records be open to any member at all times.

2. Resolution Establishing Mandatory Minimum Handbook Requirements
The Board must establish binding deadlines to enforce procedural stability and prevent the continuous administrative chaos related to documentation and reporting.
Resolution Mandate: I request the Board adopt and enforce mandatory deadlines for core administrative processes, confirming the authority of the Handbook.
• Minutes Distribution Outstanding: As of October 9, 2025, the EST stated that "Board reports will be requested on November first, compiled and sent to current Board along with spring Minutes". This confirms that the spring Minutes have not yet been distributed, potentially violating the required timely circulation documented in the Handbook.


3. Vote of No Confidence — Executive Secretary‑Treasurer (EST)
The EST’s documented handling of mandated processes and officer access requires formal Board review. The totality of these issues merits Board consideration of a Vote of No Confidence.
Resolution Mandate: Place a motion for a Vote of No Confidence regarding the continued service of the Executive Secretary-Treasurer, Jeanne Grealish, on the agenda, with supporting documentation circulated in advance.
Documented Conduct and Organizational Risk:
• Characterization of Governance: The EST stated that the Handbook is "grossly out of date" and that PMTNM "does not function under any legal mandates!". This characterization poses an Organizational Risk to PMTNM’s standing. PMTNM is a 501(c)(3) organization (tax‑exempt status granted 1981, currently in force). Operating as a 501(c)(3) imposes legal mandates regarding governance, financial transparency, and fiduciary duties.
• Documentation Delays: There was a significant delay between requesting the Handbook (January 9, 2025) and receiving a copy from the EST (July 13, 2025). I obtained an interim copy from another member on March 8, 2025. The EST stated the handbook was online, contrary to prior statements that it had not yet been posted.
• Process Concerns and Communications: The EST discouraged convening required committee processes and minimized the Vice President’s role by asserting the VP role had "no function beyond" August. Additionally, communications have included dismissive characterizations (e.g., a Foundation appeal described as "Boring and irrelevant" and facility‑research efforts as "useless").
• Awards and Succession Concerns: There have been concerns regarding the Teacher of the Year nomination process (including references to the nomination as "last year", and questions about documentation and community service) and the VP selection process.
• Nominating Committee Integrity: The EST suggested to the President that if a new VP is not on the slate, "why not have Laura choose someone she’d like to work with even if that person has not served on the Board?". This could be viewed as circumventing the formal role of the Nominating Committee, which is led by the Immediate Past President. The Board should affirm the proper succession procedure.
• Accountability of Compensation: The EST is an appointed position receiving financial compensation. Given the administrative failures, the EST's continuation in this role is problematic.

4. Zoom as Official Meeting Modality (Physical Secondary)
To ensure statewide participation and quorum regardless of venue, I request that the Board establish Zoom (or equivalent) as the official modality for all Board and committee meetings, with any physical location expressly secondary.
Resolution Mandate: Establish Zoom as the official meeting platform for all PMTNM Board and committee meetings; any in‑person option should be concurrent and secondary.
Supporting Rationale: In prior correspondence, the President noted that members in Albuquerque "won't even drive 2 miles to the event!!". A guaranteed remote‑access modality removes barriers to participation, ensures transparency, and supports equitable access across the state.

5. Secret Ballot Procedure via Email Distribution (Integrity and Oversight)
To ensure verifiable, secure, and transparent voting without reliance on a single administrator, ballots shall be submitted via email by each voting member to a dedicated Ballot Oversight Distribution List for safekeeping and audit. Resolution Mandate: Pursuant to the New Mexico Nonprofit Corporation Act—specifically § 53-8-12 NMSA 1978 (authorizing bylaws and procedures for corporate governance), § 53-8-15 NMSA 1978 (permitting voting by mail or other approved means), and § 53-8-27 NMSA 1978 (requiring proper maintenance of corporate records)—the Board shall establish and publish a Ballot Oversight Distribution List including the President, the Vice President, one designated Board Member, and one designated Member-at-Large. All votes submitted by email shall be directed to this address and retained unaltered for a minimum of three years for reconciliation and audit by the listed officers. Recognizing that email ballots are inherently traceable and therefore not fully anonymous, this resolution further authorizes the optional use of a neutral third-party facilitator (such as a CPA, attorney, or certified online voting platform) to conduct any election requiring true secrecy, ensuring that each eligible member casts one verified but anonymized ballot, and that certified results are transmitted to the Oversight List. Supporting Rationale: In light of recent administrative opacity—including delayed access to financial records, obstruction in Handbook distribution, and interference in the 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination after acknowledgment of receipt—this multi-party oversight process upholds transparency, preserves member confidence, and ensures that custody of ballot records and auditability remain beyond the control of any single administrator, consistent with fiduciary standards under New Mexico nonprofit law.

I respectfully request that these five items be placed on the agenda for the November Board meeting to support procedural integrity and accountability before officer installation and budget approval.
Sincerely,
Chip Miller Vice President, PMTNM
