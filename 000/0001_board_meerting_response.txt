Dear Sharon and Jeanne,

Thank you for your correspondence regarding the final planning steps for the November Board meeting and the "mini-conference".

While I appreciate the logistics update, particularly Sharon's question to Larry Blind regarding available room for the Friday afternoon Board meeting, the governance and financial procedural breaches currently underway pose a far greater risk to the organization than facility limitations. I must address these systemic issues immediately, especially as they pertain to the integrity of PMTNM’s financial operations and leadership succession.

1. Integrity of Officer Transition and Mandatory Training
I noted the discussion regarding materials for incoming officers and the succession plan, whereby Larry, the immediate past-president and chair of the Nominating Committee, presents the slate, and then Laura receives the gavel.
• Presidential Duty: The President is mandated to ensure continuity by keeping a close liaison with officers and acquainting the Vice President with business and plans, allocating some of the duties to the VP [Implied Handbook requirement, challenged by Sharon's silence]. Sharon, your stated inability to provide timely information or address critical issues, coupled with the EST's prior message that my VP role "has no function beyond" August, directly undermines my ability to fulfill the "understudy" role required of the Vice President and ensures future leadership transitions will be unstable.
• Nominating Process: While the EST suggested having Laura choose someone she’d like to work with for VP if the slate is missing one, we must adhere to the formal processes of the Nominating Committee chaired by Larry Blind. As the current elected Vice President who is required to serve as the successor/understudy, I must formally protest any effort to circumvent the established governance procedures for selecting the new slate.
I want to maintain a constructive environment for Laura Spitzer's future involvement, as her willingness to volunteer is vital to PMTNM's continuation. However, ensuring stable leadership requires that the current, elected officer (the VP) receives the mandated training and inclusion necessary to maintain the integrity of the office for all subsequent individuals.

2. Immediate Financial and Governance Compliance Failure
The most urgent issue preceding any conference planning is the crisis of financial compliance.
• Budgetary Exclusion: The budget for 2026-2027 must be prepared by the Budget Committee, which explicitly mandates the participation of the Vice President [Implied Handbook requirement]. Yet, the EST stated there would be "no need for an actual meeting" of the committee.
• Withheld Documentation: Financial records required for budget preparation must be "open to any member at all times", yet I have been repeatedly denied the full financial details required to perform my duties.
• Administrative Obstruction: The EST's dismissal of my efforts—including facility searches that she termed "useless"—as well as her prior statement that mandatory foundation emails are "Boring and irrelevant," demonstrates a pattern of active obstruction of the VP's required duties [Source History].
The Board cannot responsibly convene the November 7–8 meeting and vote on a budget unless the Budget Committee is formally convened and all required officers receive access to the necessary financial reports prior to the meeting, particularly since the accountant's report is expected around November 1st.

3. Official Meeting Modality — Zoom Required (Physical Secondary)
Given that we still have not agreed upon a physical location, and noting Sharon’s comment that Albuquerque members are "unwilling to travel more than 2 miles," PMTNM must guarantee statewide participation by administering the Board meeting officially by Zoom (or equivalent), with any physical venue explicitly secondary. This ensures transparency, equitable access, and reliable quorum regardless of venue uncertainty.

I formally request that the President utilize her authority to address these governance breaches immediately, thereby ensuring that the PMTNM adheres to the procedures required of a non-profit organization.

Sincerely,
Chip Miller Vice President, PMTNM
