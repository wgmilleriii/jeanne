Subject: Agenda Request for Nov 7–8 Board Meeting: Financials, Zoom as Official Venue, No‑Confidence Vote

Dear President Kunitz and Members of the PMTNM Board of Directors,

Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the PMTNM Bylaws, I respectfully request that the following three items be placed on the agenda for the November 7–8 Board Meeting. These are time‑sensitive governance matters necessary to ensure compliance, transparency, and full participation across PMTNM.

1) Review of Financials and Budget Committee Compliance
   • Provide immediate and continuous access to financial records for all required officers so the Budget Committee can fulfill its mandate to prepare and present the annual budget.
   • Schedule and notice a Budget Committee meeting prior to any budget approval at the Board Meeting, with supporting financial documents circulated in advance to the Board.

2) Zoom as the Official Meeting Venue (Physical Secondary)
   • Establish Zoom (or equivalent) as the official platform for all Board and committee meetings, with any physical venue expressly secondary.
   • Rationale: To ensure statewide participation, including members who, as noted in prior correspondence, are “not willing to travel” within Albuquerque. A guaranteed Zoom modality removes barriers and ensures quorum and inclusivity.

3) Vote of No Confidence — Executive Secretary‑Treasurer (EST)
   • Place a motion and vote regarding the continued service of the Executive Secretary‑Treasurer on the agenda.
   • Supporting documentation to be circulated in advance to the Board.

Please confirm that these three items will be added to the agenda and that related materials will be circulated in a timely manner to allow for informed deliberation.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
