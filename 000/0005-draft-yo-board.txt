**Subject: URGENT BOARD PETITION: Formal Request for Agenda Inclusion on Financial Oversight, Governance Compliance, and Secretarial Conduct (November 7–8 Meeting)**

Dear President Kunitz and Members of the PMTNM Board of Directors,

I am writing to formally request, pursuant to **Article VIII, Section 5 of the PMTNM Bylaws**, the inclusion of three resolutions on the agenda for the November 7–8 Board Meeting. These are not minor operational discussions but critical mandates necessary to resolve ongoing governance failures, which have been systematically documented since January 2025. With the Conference just four weeks away, immediate Board action is required.

### 1. Mandatory Officer Access to Financial Records

The Budget Committee must convene to prepare the budget for the coming year and present it for approval at the Conference Board Meeting. The continued denial of financial access to elected officers has rendered this fundamental fiduciary process invalid.

**Resolution Mandate:** The Board shall mandate the **immediate and continuous access** for the Vice President and all required officers to PMTNM’s comprehensive financial documentation.

**Supporting Rationale for Financial Urgency:**

*   **Denied Access:** My formal request for **"full financial details per handbook guidelines"** on March 17, 2025, was ignored by the Secretary, violating the requirement that records **"should be open to any member at all times"**.
*   **Budget Committee Obstruction:** The EST confirmed that once CPA reports are received, **"There probably will be no need for an actual meeting"** of the Budget Committee. This dismissal contradicts my mandated role and the requirement that the VP serves on the Budget Committee, a role the EST claimed **"has no function beyond that"** August.
*   **Repudiation of Legal Authority:** The EST explicitly stated that the Handbook is **"grossly out of date"** and PMTNM **"does not function under any legal mandates!"**. This statement must be formally addressed by the Board to confirm the organization's legal compliance.

### 2. Resolution Establishing Mandatory Minimum Handbook Requirements

The administrative failure to circulate and maintain necessary governing documents threatens procedural clarity and officer continuity, confirming the need for binding deadlines to restore function.

**Resolution Mandate:** The Board shall formally adopt and enforce defined deadlines for core administrative processes as the minimum operational standard, including:

*   **Officer and Chair Reports:** All officers and committee chairs must send **requested reports to the Executive Secretary-Treasurer one month prior to the spring and fall Board Meetings**.
*   **Board Meeting Minutes:** Minutes of all Board meetings must be sent to members **"within 60 days after the meetings"**.
*   **Nominating Committee Roster:** The Nominating Committee must present the roster of candidates to the President and EST **"at least 15 days and preferably 21 days before the opening date of the annual State Conference"**.

**Supporting Rationale for Standardization:**
The "prolonged gap between requesting the Handbook and obtaining a copy only via Ferrell Roberts is bewildering" [Previous Communication History]. Similarly, while I requested the current membership list in January 2025 to fulfill my duties, **"I was not sent the list"**. The EST suggested the list was **"supposed to be online"**, but administrative confusion led to my inability to perform membership outreach. The Board must establish clear, enforceable document distribution protocols.

### 3. Resolution for a Vote of No Confidence Regarding the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST)

The EST’s repeated efforts to obstruct the Vice President's duties, dismiss governing documents, and interfere in formal processes constitutes a profound failure of administrative duty that warrants a Vote of No Confidence by the Board.

**Resolution Mandate:** The Board shall initiate a formal motion for a **Vote of No Confidence** concerning the continued service of the Executive Secretary-Treasurer, Jeanne Grealish.

**Supporting Rationale for Review of Conduct:**

*   **Administrative Sabotage:** The EST actively attempted to derail my mandated duties, including dismissing Teacher of the Year nomination documents for Teri Resch by repeatedly framing the **"2025 Teacher of the Year nomination"** as "last year", and questioning the nominee's community service.
*   **Thwarting Succession and Nominations:** The EST suggested in writing that the incoming president, **Laura Spitzer, should "choose someone she’d like to work with"** for the next VP, grossly attempting to circumvent the Nominating Committee process [Previous Communication History].
*   **Scorn and Obstruction:** The EST has demonstrated a persistent pattern of hostility, blocking access to information, and diminishing the VP's efforts. The failure of this appointed position, despite receiving financial compensation, is bewildering and demands immediate review by the elected Board [Previous Communication History].

I formally request that these three resolutions be placed on the agenda for the November 7–8 Board of Directors meeting for immediate discussion and vote.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
