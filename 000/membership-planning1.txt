Ok. I will keep a running list of questions as we find a way forward so I don't overload either of you with questions daily.

Chip,


An earlier email from MTNA requested officers but we still do not have all the chairs.  I can forward that the President and VP positions are filled.

Thank you, Jeanne. Where is it? Or are you simply verifying that the attachment is accurate as of today? Do you have an email from MTNA with the current membership or are you confirming that the MTNA does not distribute this information to state leadership? Is MTNA aware of our current leadership? Please clarify and provide more information. Thank you, Jeanne!

Hi Sharon, 
Here is data from the old site. I also shared a good sheet with you , https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NEz0q2wEy-3DIOU0S6uvOAuP_swEZnx-JM7Eabnibts/edit?usp=sharing . Would it be useful for us to be able to share documents like this in Google Drive ? 

I think the need to reach out to national to get the updated list though. This is a start but it has not been updated for a long time as I understand. Jeanne can you do that?

Chip,

Do you have the listing for a mass mailing to the membership?  I want to send them a New Year's greeting and plans for the year.

Thanks,
Sharon
