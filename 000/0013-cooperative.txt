Subject: Re: Conference Planning — Thoughts on Practical Solutions

Sharon,

Thank you for your update on the facility search. I appreciate you taking this on, and I understand the challenges you're facing with venue availability and the $2,400 cost consideration, especially given the uncertainty around attendance size.

I've been thinking about ways we might address both the fiscal concerns and our organizational needs, and I'd like to share some ideas for your consideration:

I. Conference Educational Components: Exploring Virtual Options
The venue cost challenge made me think about our earlier conversations regarding online professional development. What if we offered the workshops and masterclasses virtually? This could:
- Significantly reduce our venue rental costs
- Make sessions accessible to members across the state (which might help with the participation challenges you've mentioned)
- Align with what National has encouraged regarding online conferences
- Provide professional development without the financial risk of uncertain in-person attendance

II. State Honors Auditions: Video Submission Consideration
State Honors requires considerable organizational coordination—repertoire lists, judge coordination, and the Saturday recital. Since we're still working to identify an Honors Chair (as you mentioned back in May), I wonder if we should consider accepting video submissions this year, similar to what we did during COVID. The District Vice Presidents could help coordinate collecting recordings since they're already managing District Auditions. This approach might:
- Simplify the venue requirements considerably
- Preserve the competition opportunity for students
- Reduce the volunteer coordination needed

III. Mandatory Meetings: Keeping It Simple
If we went with virtual educational programming and video Honors submissions, the November 7–8 event could be streamlined to just the Board Meeting and General Membership Meeting. These could work in a smaller, lower-cost space (even a home), with Zoom for remote participants as we've done before.

Moving Forward Together
I know we also need to work through the governance items I raised in my earlier messages—the budget committee process, access to financial records, and formalizing Zoom access. I'd welcome the chance to talk through both the practical conference planning and these procedural questions so we can find an approach that works for everyone.

Would you have time for a call this week to discuss these ideas? I'm happy to work with you on whatever direction makes the most sense given the constraints we're facing.

Thanks for your leadership on this,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
