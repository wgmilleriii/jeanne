Subject: Response to Oct 9 Board Meeting Planning Email — Venue Consideration and Member Inclusion

Dear President Kunitz,

Thank you for your message sent Thu, Oct 9 at 1:56 PM. I am writing in response to the ongoing planning for the upcoming Board meeting and related events, specifically regarding consideration of Larry’s school as a venue.

First, I want to note that I was not included in the planning discussions where Larry’s school was presented or considered as an option. As Vice President, it is essential that I be included in these conversations so that I can fulfill my responsibilities and ensure we are making decisions that are transparent, equitable, and fully informed.

Second, several members, particularly from Albuquerque, have expressed concerns that Larry’s advertisements and promotions could alienate local colleagues. This sensitivity is heightened by the fact that Larry’s school currently does not employ any MTNA‑certified teachers. In that context, placing his institution in a position of prominence risks signaling endorsement or preference by PMTNM.

Third, there is a perceived historical precedence of elevating Larry’s school above others—both on the website he created and at the last conference. Taken together, these factors suggest at minimum the appearance of preferential treatment, which we should actively mitigate.

To move forward constructively, I request that:
1) All prospective venues, including Larry’s school, be evaluated against the same, published criteria (capacity, cost, accessibility, neutrality, conflict‑of‑interest safeguards, and member impact), and that those criteria and scores be circulated to the Board before a decision is made.
2) Any real or perceived conflicts of interest be disclosed in writing, and the relevant individuals recuse themselves from related decisions in accordance with best practices.
3) External communications avoid vendor‑style promotion of any single school or business and reflect PMTNM’s neutral, member‑serving posture.
4) This venue‑selection item be placed on the formal agenda and that supporting materials be shared sufficiently in advance so all Board members can participate meaningfully.

Please confirm that I will be included on all further planning communications and that this item will be added to the agenda. I am available to help compile a neutral, criteria‑based venue comparison and to coordinate member input so the Board can make a fair, transparent decision.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
