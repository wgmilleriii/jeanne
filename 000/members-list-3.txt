Hi Jeanne, thank you for helping. Can you clarify? Your question please? Also thank you again for your input for putting back the mountain. I look at it every day. Do you like the early morning sun or the evening sun? I am attaching three pictures (not to be distributed for professional evaluation) just your input on color scheme because the color is great right now. I was thinking too about music? IE do you want to have music playing in the background (with proper controls) like “hall of the mountain king” or “climb every mountain” or something maybe a little more sophisticated? Some people may not like music though.  Thank you, Chip

This email makes absolutely no sense.

Who authorized a questionnaire in the first place?

Who is the elected head of PMTNM who assigns tasks? Not me for sure.
