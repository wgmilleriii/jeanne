Hi Chip,

 

I don’t know of any affiliate or association that has ever needed to protect themselves against an institution or has implemented policies or bylaws to do so. I’m not an attorney, but what you are suggesting about not allowing an organization to advertise, attend or have voting power sounds like it could be considered an anticompetitive practice and, if determined to be anticompetitive, would be cause for MTNA to disaffiliate with that organization and we would be required to report the violation to the Federal Trade Commission.

Thank you for your thorough followups as always, Brian.

 

I have one clarifying comment:

Regarding your other question, I don’t know of any nonprofit organizations with bylaws that would address the contracts of individual members with their employers. 

I would like to know if a local chapter ever needed to protect themselves, through their bylaws or policy, against any institution or company (e.g., we will not allow x to advertise / attend / have voting power etc because of y).

 

Thank you for your encouragement for open dialog. I had been considering a proposal to the virtual seminar and your response helped me make the decision to continue.

Dear Chip,

 

As promised, I discussed your request for a language revision in the MTNA Code of Ethics with the MTNA President, President-elect and Immediate Past President. We were all in agreement that the language written by our attorney, reviewed by the attorneys at the Federal Trade Commission and approved by the MTNA Board of Directors was still appropriate for the Code since there is no way of knowing or addressing all the types of teaching scenarios and agreements that are happening across the country.

 

I think there is some confusion on what the MTNA Code of Ethics is and can be used for, so I want to make sure to clear that up. The MTNA Code of Ethics is aspirational and cannot be enforced and used as a formal disciplinary tool, whether an ethical violation is identified or not. MTNA can only provide these guidelines as a suggested means of self-regulation for the profession and try to encourage open dialogue. The FTC made this very clear in its investigation of the statement regarding the transfer and recruitment of students that used to be in the MTNA Code of Ethics back in 2013/2014, thus the change to the current language and procedures.

 

Regarding your other question, I don’t know of any nonprofit organizations with bylaws that would address the contracts of individual members with their employers. Things like that typically wouldn’t appear in the bylaws. Since employment contracts are legally binding documents (and not just aspirational), the terms and implications of those would need to be explored with an attorney and not something I can advise on.

 

I hope this provides some additional information that is helpful.

 

Best wishes,

 

Brian

I am extremely grateful for the time and thought that you put into carefully considering this matter, Brian, and that you treated it with importance and dignity despite even your Covid bout. Thank you.

 

I am surprised that there are limitations of this process based on the member's employment. I do not see this clarification on the ethics pages online. 

 

It appears that the contract of a second organization can create a scenario that contradicts the efforts of the Code of Ethics, effectively making exempt from the Code and its process the MTNA members in the second organization.  As this inquiry draws to a close, may I ask two things? First, are you aware of any bylaws or other process in a local chapter that would protect them from scenarios in which the Code would be ignored or neglected because of a contract of a second organization; that places limits or restrictions on members of second organizations; that clarifies the ultimate authority of the Code when other contracts create conflicting scenarios; or, are you aware of how similar situations with second organizations were handled and could point me to a resource? Our local chapter (PMTNM) has suffered much over the years because of the actions of the directors of the New Mexico School of Music; a long-time board member Ferrell Roberts described the group to me as "so broken it will have to be completely rebuilt or it will not survive." I have now been asked to serve as VP, and want to proceed with respect for all. Second, if this exchange may assist by creating a case for adding to the MTNA bylaws, protecting another member or chapter, or in any update to the Code, would please use it to its fullest capability?

 

Should you have no answers at this time to either of those questions, I will sign off from this thread, again with gratitude to you for your time and thoughts, and would look forward to meeting you in person and shaking your hand in thanks.

Good morning,

 

Thank you for sending this additional information. The MTNA Code of Ethics statements about the transfer process were to guide the process between individual studio teachers and not in a situation like this where there is an institutional policy regarding teaching staff resignations. From what I am reading the students/parents contract with the school and not directly with the teacher for lessons, so the school’s policies would dictate the transfer process. While you don’t agree with the policy and it sounds like didn’t sign a contract with them, the policy was provided and from the information you provided, it sounds like it was followed explicitly. Because of this, I don’t see this as an ethical infringement that can be mediated by MTNA.

 

I realize that this isn’t the outcome that you had hoped for, but since there was a written policy provided that explained what happens following a teacher resignation, this dispute falls outside of the MTNA Code of Ethics mediation process.

 

I wish you much success in your future endeavors.

 

Sincerely,

 

Brian

Thank you Brian for giving the matter thought, and for clarifying the limitations of the outcome.

 

I would request that the amount of time that passed to not be a factor. I will be in the same room this fall with Tatiana and Larry, and believe that they in full intent did malign my character. I do believe that this refusal to participate the change of teachers is a clear violation of the ethics code. 

 

As a reminder: I did not execute their employment contract, nor did I receive a copy until after a month's teaching. But, yes, they do have a separation clause which have attached it to this email. I do see that had I executed this contract, my informing the parent of my departure would have been a violation.  After reading their termination clause, I must ask, does this even support our Code, including "the teacher shall respect the student's right to obtain instruction from the teacher of their choice"?

 

I recognize the limitations of the outcome to not include revoking membership, and that the code is only a guideline. I would still hope that your evaluation of the practice of this School carries weight, and that the documentation I have provided shows unethical behavior to the extent that you would declare it so, even if Tatiana would not accept it or offer an apology or any attempt to clear the air with the offended parent.

Good morning,

 

I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. I ended up with COVID last week and am now playing catch up. Tatiana is a current member of the association. Inclusion in the teacher directory is optional, so she may have never opted in or decided to opt out at some point.

 

I have reviewed the documentation that you have sent, as well as your desired outcome. I want it to be clear that the MTNA Code of Ethics is aspirational, and I cannot legally use it to revoke membership. While I’m not sure that mediation will be helpful in this particular situation, given the time that has passed, was there anything included in the employment contract that you mentioned regarding resignation, the transfer of students etc?

Good morning Brian,

 

Though this remains unresolved, it may not be your problem: I do not see Tatiana's name on the MTNA teacher finder. 

 

If you could confirm that she is actually no longer a member, there would be no reason for your involvement that I could see, until she wanted to renew her membership.

Thank you Brian for your response.

The great problem is that there was no previous email from Tatiana other than #4 (p. 7). Her thoughts in that email were "So far, I do not see any misunderstanding or ethical violation from our side."

The chain of events behind this complaint are related to my employment at the New Mexico School of Music.

4/30 I began caring for the pianos at NMSM at their piano technician. This is my primary work. I began caring for the pianos at their largest school competitor, the Albuquerque Institute, 4/27.

6/12 I told  (T.V. and Larry) that I would set aside two half-days a week to teach for them; T.V. had told me that there was a "long waiting list."  

6/19 I emailed Larry days and times, expecting to begin teaching immediately. After 8 weeks of limbo, waiting on them, and losing time, I began teaching lessons for them 8/10.

On 9/1 I received a contract from them - 30 pages - which Larry handed to me and signed in front of me, backdating to match Tatiana's signature 7/20. I began reading the contract and found things that made me uncomfortable, especially their non-compete and ownership clauses. Between 9/1 and 10/10 I continued teaching, trying to concentrate on caring for the students but becoming increasingly aware of their business practices.

9/28 I was approached by the parent (Toni) of a student (Evan). This parent was on the board at a private school, and asked if I would visit the school with the intention of building an after-school program there.

10/10 I formally requested a meeting with T.V., and asked Larry to join.

10/13 I told them I decided that I would rather be a "resource to the community" and receive students from either the Institute or the NMSM as either owner would see fit for a good student/teacher match. I saw Larry's jaw and neck stiffen, his eyes narrow, teeth grit, and heard him say "no, you would then be working for the com-pe-ti-tion" in a voice that was hateful and intolerant - so much so that I was caught offguard and remained as silent as I could through the rest of the meeting. I struggled inwardly for the next 12 days to justify continuing to teach for them, and could find no inner peace in the thought of continuing.

I resigned from NMSM 10/25; they asked if I would continue teaching through the end of the semester, and I offered that I would do so if they would commit a tuning contract back to me. They took the offer no further.  On 11/19 T.V. would email me that my last day for them was 10/15.

I spent some time on the Menaul campus, about two hours, with the assistant head of school. This planning for this visit began on 10/25, and my visit was 11/9. It was important to me that I formally sever the relationship with NMSM before beginning building something else.

Until 11/9 my relationship with Toni was spotless; she consistently expressed thanks for the lessons I was giving her son, and enthusiastic about my assisting the musical progression at her school, Menaul. The evening of 11/9 I received an email from Toni that was a 180degree turnaround from all of my previous interactions with her, and in which she made references to things I was "supposed to do" that I had no idea what she was talking about.

From Toni:
I understand that you committed to bringing some music that Evan could use for his upcoming auditions to Evan's lessons at NM School of Music. I realize that you gave notice and left your job, but could you not have provided the music to the school, left notes or emailed me the music as part of succession planning for Evan?
Commitment to bringing music? No idea. "Upcoming auditions"?? For a school he's already taking lessons at? I was completely confused.

I tried to resolve it by email, received no response, and requested meetings with T.V. and Toni to resolve things, and received no responses. What kind of messages were given to Toni in regards to things that I had "committed to"?? The PMTNM conference was 11/10-12. Larry refused conversations with me during the conference, though I asked politely and made myself clearly available multiple times; he made no effort to schedule a meeting with me after the conference.

11/13: Based on the tone of Toni's email, and accusations therein, I followed up with the Menaul assistant head and expressed to him my concern in suddenly receiving an accusatory email from Toni. He confirmed that I had not misrepresented myself and that my approaches to the school were blameless, but decided that I could not pursue any further relationship with Menaul as long as a board member was upset at me.

11/14 Larry texted me "Chip, please do not contact any of your former students from our school by phone or email. This is not appropriate and I have received an email from a parent who was not very happy about your call." T.V. was then brought into that conversation.

Brian, I would like to address the gap in time (@9 months) between these exchanges and my email to you. 11/14 I contacted Gary Ingle (see attached PDF) requesting his assistance. There are two topics: my personal interactions with Blind, and - with greater importance - my experience at the PMTNM convention. After Ingle's response 12/5, I began following through with contacting board members to address these concerns. Since then, my conversations in the community have confirmed my concerns over both Blind and T.V. My next scheduled meeting within the PMTNM board is with the current VP Cheryl Pachak-Brooks; as Cheryl recently retired from ENMU, where I have also been employed as a technician; I am grateful that I no longer need to balance client relationships with my PMTNM concerns. Now I am completing my stated intentions to T.V. by reporting what I perceive is an ethical violation on her part. I believe it is best to involve you now, as I intend to remain involved in PMTNM and serve where I am needed. I also believe the timing is gentle on the concerned student and parent (Evan and Toni) as they would have had the opportunity to complete an academic year of study without additional drama; and I believe that they should be given an opportunity to fully and accurately consider things before signing up for further lessons.

As I have began reading these emails recently after months of separation from them, I was actually shocked again at the way I was treated - ignored and apparently maligned, to the detriment of not just losing face with one family, but also with a delay (at best) with establishing a relationship with an entire boarding school. I do not think that I could have more clearly requested or made a case for the need for open communication.

Tatiana has had ample time to respond.

I am prepared for you to share the document regarding Tatiana with Tatiana. I am prepared to sit down with that document, Tatiana, and the parent to review it. I am prepared to reopen an email exchange with Tatiana, using that document, copying you on the exchange, and notifying her that I have requested your involvement to identify and resolve an ethical dispute.

As far as my desired outcome:
If you the president of MTNA determine that Tatiana violated the code of ethics, she should accept your verdict. Her response should be a full admission of responsibility, an apology to the parent for mishandling the transfer of student, and an apology for defamation of character. I should receive written apologies from Larry as I requested, and her letter to the parent should indicate that she required him to do this. I would not leave it up to T.V. to write this letter herself and attempt to "close the issue" with an incomplete apology. If you the president determine that a violation occurred, and she does not accept your decision, I do not see how her MTNA membership could or should continue.

 

Given her position in the community I have approached you, the president of MTNA, after many hours of thought, and having now conversed with others in the community who have confirmed my feelings regarding both T.V. and Blind. The situation is not trivial.

Dear Willis,

 

Thank you for contacting MTNA. I have reviewed the materials you sent and I’m a little unclear as to the events that caused this train of emails. Would you be able to provide a brief written summary of what occurred in addition to the correspondence you sent? It seems like there might be some missing correspondence with Tatiana, as she indicated in one email that she had already provided her thoughts. Also, since it’s been nearly nine months since your last interactions with Tatiana and Larry, is there a desired outcome that you are hoping to achieve through the mediation process?

 

Thanks in advance for providing additional information.

Dear Mr. Shepard,

 

I am writing to you for assistance in the resolution of an ethical dispute. I hold that my requests for open communication with a parent during a change of teachers was ignored, and my requests for clarification and the resolution of any misunderstandings was ignored.

 

Under “Commitment to Colleagues”:
The teacher shall participate in the student's change of teachers with as much communication as possible between parties, while being sensitive to the privacy rights of the student and families.

 

Please see the attached PDFs "Ethical_Dispute_Request.pdf" for my contact information and “Ethical Dispute - Miller-Vetrinskaya.pdf” for the documentation.

 

I am grateful for your time and consideration.

 

Respectfully,

Willis Miller
