**Subject: URGENT: Formal Petition for Board Resolution to Address Systemic Governance Breaches and Ensure Financial Oversight Prior to November 7–8 Conference**

Dear Sharon and Members of the PMTNM Board of Directors,

Thank you for the recent communications regarding officer transition and conference planning. I acknowledge the vital importance of smoothly transitioning leadership to the incoming officers, including **Laura Spitzer**, who has volunteered to be the next president.

However, the continued disregard for governance requirements has created severe procedural and financial instability, making decisions at the November Conference Board Meeting potentially invalid. Given that the Conference is merely four weeks away, immediate action by the Board is required.

Pursuant to **Article VIII, Section 5 of the PMTNM Bylaws**, which grants any member the right to place a concern on the agenda, I formally request that the Board dedicate the necessary time to address these critical issues.

### I. Crisis of Financial Oversight and Repudiation of Governing Documents

The foundation of PMTNM's operation—its financial accountability—is currently compromised by the systematic exclusion of officers from their mandated duties and the rejection of the Bylaws themselves.

1.  **Denial of Access to Financial Records:** Despite the Handbook mandate that financial records **"should be open to any member at all times"**, my repeated requests for **"full financial details per handbook guidelines"** have been denied.
2.  **Budget Committee Obstruction:** The Bylaws require the Budget Committee, which includes the Vice President, to **"prepare a budget for the coming year and present the budget to the Board for approval at the Conference Board Meeting"**. Yet, the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST) responded to my inquiry by stating, **"There probably will be no need for an actual meeting"**. The EST previously dismissed my participation, claiming the VP position **"has no function beyond"** August.
3.  **Financial Management Instability:** This procedural failure is exacerbated by the documented confusion over bank accounts, which led to **Larry Blind** formally requesting to be **"removed from the PMTNM bank accounts"**, underscoring the necessity of strict financial oversight.
4.  **Denial of Legal Mandates:** The EST further dismissed these governance concerns by stating that the Handbook is **"grossly out of date"** and that PMTNM **"does not function under any legal mandates!"**. This statement, which undermines the organization's fiduciary and compliance requirements, requires immediate correction by the Board.

### II. Systematic Exclusion from Officer Duties and Lack of Training

My ability to function as the mandated "understudy to succeed the President" [Implied role] has been actively undermined by presidential inaction and administrative scorn.

1.  **Presidential Silence on Training:** I have repeatedly sought your guidance on my responsibilities, asking for clarification on expectations and communications. Your reply instructing me that my duties primarily involve the **Foundation** and **recruiting members**, while you **"will handle other areas,"** failed to provide the necessary framework for me to prepare for succession. Furthermore, when I was faced with administrative hostility (such as the EST's criticism of my mandated Foundation work as **"Boring and irrelevant"**), your silence implicitly validates this scorn [Source History].
2.  **Exclusion from Planning:** The decision to plan the **"mini conference"** through an ad hoc group that includes yourself, the EST, the Immediate Past President, and **Laura Spitzer** excludes the current Vice President from his mandated role in formal conference planning, while actively dismissing legitimate efforts to assist (such as facility research, which the EST termed **"useless"**) [Source History/Previous Communication].

### III. Formal Resolution Request for Board Action (Requires 2/3 Vote)

To immediately restore confidence and procedural compliance, I formally request that the Board utilize its power to override Executive Committee decisions by enacting the following resolutions by a **two-thirds vote**:

**A. Mandatory Enforcement of Financial Fiduciary Duties**

The Board must mandate that the EST immediately provide the Vice President (and all appropriate officers) with access to **all financial records**, thus fulfilling the Bylaws requirement for transparency and enabling the VP to perform their duty on the Budget Committee.

**B. Required Digital Accessibility for All Meetings**

**Zoom (or equivalent reliable video conferencing)** shall be established as the **required standard** for all PMTNM Executive Committee and Board of Directors meetings.

**Supporting Rationale:** This policy ensures full engagement for remote colleagues and addresses the critical problem of member reluctance to travel for organizational activities.

**C. Reform of Election Process for Transparency**

To guarantee election integrity amidst transparency failures (e.g., membership list denial), the process for collecting "secret" ballots must be secured by multi-officer oversight.

**Policy Mandate:** **The Board shall establish a Ballot Audit Committee (BAC)** to oversee the collection and counting of all electronic ballots. This committee shall consist of five mandated representatives: **the President, the Vice President, the Executive Secretary-Treasurer, one designated Board Member, and one designated Member at Large.**

This reform protects the election process, ensuring that the integrity of the vote is auditable by officers and members-at-large.

I formally request that these items be placed on the agenda for the November 7–8 Board of Directors meeting. Failure to address these governance breaches before the conference will severely undermine the validity of any actions taken, including budget approval and officer installation.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
