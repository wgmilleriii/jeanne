Dear Sharon and Members of the PMTNM Board of Directors,

Thank you for your recent planning correspondence regarding the November Board meeting and the "mini‑conference." While I appreciate the logistics updates, the governance and financial procedural breaches currently underway pose a greater risk to the organization than facility arrangements. Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the PMTNM Bylaws, I respectfully submit the following three agenda requests for the November 7–8 Board Meeting, with supporting context for each.

1. Financial Oversight and Budget Committee Compliance (Immediate Action Required)
The Board cannot responsibly convene to approve a budget without satisfying mandated fiduciary steps.
• Budget Committee Mandate: The Budget Committee must prepare the budget for the coming year and present it for approval at the Conference Board Meeting. Despite the conference being weeks away, the committee has not met; the EST has stated there would be "no need for an actual meeting." This is incompatible with the committee’s purpose and the VP’s mandated role on the committee.
• Officer Access: Financial documentation is to be available for scrutiny by officers—yet repeated requests for "full financial details per handbook guidelines" have been denied. Denial of officer access renders any budget approval procedurally unsound.
• Bank Signatures and Account Status: At the spring meeting, it was stated on the record that "Sharon and I need to go to the bank" to resolve signature cards with Bank of America, and prior attempts resulted in “a fit” of forms and back‑and‑forth, with uncertainty whether prior signers completed the process; it was then determined to rescind the prior motion and proceed with the EST and President as signers, with a commitment to "try to get that taken care of" (PMTNM board transcript at ~1:35:42–1:36:24).
• Multiple Accounts Requiring Consolidation: It was also stated, "we have two different treasury… two different bank accounts. So we have to consolidate" (PMTNM board transcript at ~22:24–23:45).
• Removal Requests from Bank Accounts: Larry Blind formally requested to be "removed from the PMTNM bank accounts," adding that "[Jeanne] should NOT be the only person left on those accounts" (email forwarded Dec 13, 2024).
• Required Remedy: Convene the Budget Committee on notice prior to November 7–8; provide full and continuous access to financials for all required officers; complete signer updates and any needed consolidations; circulate the accountant’s report and supporting financials to the Board in advance to allow informed review.

2. Zoom as the Official Meeting Venue; Physical Secondary (Participation Guarantee)
To ensure statewide participation and transparency, meeting administration must guarantee remote access irrespective of physical venue.
• Rationale: In prior correspondence, President Kunitz noted that Albuquerque members **"won't even drive 2 miles to the event!!"** Establishing Zoom (or equivalent) as the official modality eliminates barriers to participation, ensures quorum, and preserves equitable access for all members across New Mexico. Any physical location should be expressly secondary to the Zoom session.
• Required Remedy: Adopt a standing policy that all Board and committee meetings are officially administered by Zoom, with any in‑person option simultaneously provided, not substituted. Post Zoom details with notices and agendas so members can reliably attend.

3. Vote of No Confidence — Executive Secretary‑Treasurer (EST)
The EST’s pattern of dismissing mandated processes and obstructing officer duties requires Board review.
• Documented Conduct: Repeated refusals to provide financial documentation needed for the budget process; minimizing or negating the role of the VP (e.g., asserting the VP role had "no function beyond" August); discouraging required committee processes; and issuing hostile communications toward the VP, including labeling mandated Foundation communications as "Boring and irrelevant" and dismissing VP facility‑research efforts as "useless."
• Organizational Risk: This conduct impairs fiduciary oversight, undermines governance continuity, and erodes member trust.
• Required Remedy: Place a motion for a Vote of No Confidence regarding the continued service of the EST on the agenda, with supporting documentation circulated in advance.

Additional Context on Minutes and Officer Process
• Minutes Distribution Outstanding: As of Oct 9, 2025, it was stated that "Board reports will be requested on November first, compiled and sent to current Board along with spring Minutes. Given the lack of recent membership meetings, there is little to send" (email from EST to President). Thus, spring Minutes have not yet been distributed to the Board.
• VP Selection Process: In the same Oct 9 message, it was suggested, "Do we have a new VP on the slate? If not, why not have Laura choose someone she’d like to work with even if that person has not served on the Board? (The current one had not!)." This suggestion runs counter to the formal role of the Nominating Committee and the defined officer succession process, and should be addressed by the Board to affirm proper procedure.

Formal Requests
• Place these three items on the agenda for the November 7–8 Board Meeting.
• Confirm Zoom as the official modality for the meeting so statewide participation is guaranteed.
• Circulate all relevant materials (financials, accountant’s report, committee documentation) sufficiently in advance so the Board can deliberate responsibly.

I remain committed to constructive collaboration and to ensuring PMTNM meets its fiduciary and governance responsibilities. Please confirm that these items will be added to the agenda and that the required materials and Zoom details will be distributed promptly.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
