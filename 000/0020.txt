One of the churches visited this morning was the Holy Cross Lutheran Church, on Wyoming across from Academy.  Just around the corner from our neighborhood.  Just had call from pastor and she had checked with their council.  We have the facility for Saturday, Nov. 8.  I will meet her tomorrow morning 9 - 10:30AM for paper work, and I will need to get insurance papers from you, Jeanne.  They do not have a janitor, but as she told the council president, musicians are not messy!!!  She says the piano is a good baby grand.... will check that and probably need tuning.

The pastor was an organ major at Texas Lutheran College and also was a voice and piano minor.  I told her she should belong to our association.

Hope this works out!!
