Subject: Re: Holy Cross Lutheran Church — Piano

Sharon,

Thanks for moving quickly on Holy Cross Lutheran Church.

I don’t have any record of that piano. A baby grand may or may not suffice for our pianists, depending on make, condition, and recent maintenance. At the last Honors event at Immanuel Presbyterian, several parents were not shy with complaints when the piano wasn’t “ideal,” so I want to be mindful of expectations.

Could you share the make/model (a quick photo is fine) and when it was last tuned? That will help us gauge fit.

Appreciate your work on this,

Chip
