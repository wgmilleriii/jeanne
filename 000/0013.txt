Sharon,
I trust you are managing the facility search as best you can, given the challenges you mentioned regarding venue availability and the prohibitive cost of securing a space for even a "very mini conference". Frankly, spending $2,400 on a venue for a questionable size audience, when we are merely fulfilling mandatory meetings, requires prudence.
Given the impending date, and recalling the historical issue of badly attended sessions and the operational drain of complex in-person events:
I. Conference Aspects: Leverage Online Modalities
We have discussed the growing trend toward virtual educational offerings, and even National encouraged us to explore online conferences. To immediately mitigate financial risk and broaden reach, we could strip this November event to the bare constitutional necessities and move all ancillary educational offerings online.
Therefore, I strongly suggest that the "conference" aspects—specifically the workshops and masterclasses—be organized as virtual events. This allows us to offer the professional development our members seek without incurring high venue rental fees or relying on unreliable in-person attendance that has plagued us in the past. This shift aligns with the sentiment that members are finding online workshops (MTNA, Francis Clark Center) more accessible.
II. State Honors Auditions: Remote Submission
The logistics for State Honors demand an incredible amount of organizational expertise and personnel—especially preparing the repertoire lists and rushing programs for the Saturday Winners' Recital.
Do we still lack a volunteer to serve as the Honors Chair? Without dedicated leadership, forcing this large, complicated event in-person complicates your already difficult venue search.
To preserve the competition opportunity for students while simplifying execution, we should seriously consider making the State Honors Auditions entirely virtual. We can instruct District Vice Presidents—who already organize the District Auditions—to manage the collection of student video recordings, submitted in the same manner as was required during the COVID crisis.
If we proceed with a video submission format for Honors, the physical November 7-8 event can be reduced entirely to the mandated Board Meeting and General Membership Meeting. These meetings could easily be hosted in a home or smaller, lower-cost location, further saving institutional funds and eliminating the current venue headaches.
We could responsibly evaluate our current position and recognize that last-minute planning may not be the best offering for our members and that a very good, small offering that fulfills requirements will be better than one put together at the last minute. There has been a precedent for online events, and the ease of execution compared to a physical event may make it a better choice. We should make efficient, financially sound choices to ensure the vitality of the organization, particularly ahead of the 2026 Jubilee.
Let us discuss this course of action immediately.

Everyone,

Happy for the sunshine and visited 3 new locations, making a total of 12 so far.  One church is having fall festival that weekend, another church doesnt have piano -  only keyboard.  Both were very big churches and seemed very disorganized.  Stopped at a smaller Lutheran church in area and they are checking with facility manager.  I am meeting lots of "Facility managers"!!

A couple weeks ago, I sent out email to AMTA members for their help, but no response.  Will do again today.  Any ideas?   There are certainly lots of smaller non-denominationalll churches but I can't see them all!!

Later,

Sharon
