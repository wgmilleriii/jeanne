**Subject: URGENT GOVERNANCE AND ETHICAL MANDATES: Necessity of Fiduciary Compliance, Digital Accessibility, and Review of Ethical Conflicts for November 7–8 Board Meeting**

Dear Sharon and Members of the PMTNM Board of Directors,

I am writing in response to the latest planning for the November 7–8 Board Meeting, specifically regarding the proposed venue at **Larry Blind’s school/Berna Facco facility**. I must formally insist that any Board meeting held must adhere to strict protocols regarding financial oversight, transparency, and ethical conduct.

Furthermore, given the geographical obstacles and documented history of low member participation, **I formally request the immediate mandate of mandatory, officially administered digital access for all meetings.**

### I. Mandate A: Required Digital Accessibility for All Meetings (Zoom)

The Board must acknowledge and formalize the use of technology to ensure that participation is genuinely accessible to all members across the state.

**Resolution Mandate:** Regardless of the physical location chosen, all PMTNM Board of Directors, Executive Committee, and official organizational meetings must be administered officially by **Zoom (or equivalent reliable video conferencing)** to ensure mandatory accessibility and participation for members across the entire state.

**Supporting Rationale for Mandatory Digital Meetings:**

*   **Geographic Inclusion:** This mandate is necessary because, as the EST noted, **"Members in ABQ won't even drive 2 miles to the event!!"**. This inability or unwillingness to travel for meetings highlights the necessity of making remote participation the default standard.
*   **Existing Practice and Need:** President Kunitz has previously acknowledged the value of remote access for members who are **"out of town far away better to have this than nothing, right?"**. While Zoom is **"usually set up"**, establishing it as a formal requirement ensures consistent, equitable participation, fulfilling the spirit of the Bylaws which permit **"Telephone or electronic polling"** for the Executive Committee to transact business.

### II. Fiduciary Crisis and Invalidity of Conference Action

Proceeding with the Board Meeting and voting on the budget without satisfying mandatory financial compliance poses an acute legal risk to the organization.

*   **Failure of Budgetary Duty:** The requirement that the Budget Committee, which includes the Vice President, meet to prepare the budget for the **Conference Board Meeting** has been ignored. I was explicitly told there is **"no need for an actual meeting"**.
*   **Denial of Access:** I have been denied access to **financial records, CPA's reports, check book, receipts, and vouchers** despite the Handbook requiring these documents to be **"open to any member at all times"**.
*   **Repudiation of Governance:** This disregard is reinforced by the EST's statement that the Handbook is **"grossly out of date"** and PMTNM **"does not function under any legal mandates!"**.

The Board cannot responsibly approve the budget or elect new officers until these foundational issues of governance and financial transparency are rectified.

### III. Ethical Conflicts and Public Relations Harm

The selection of the meeting venue must be reviewed in light of ethical conflicts and public relations sensitivity, which threaten the organization’s relationship with local teachers.

*   **Conflict of Interest (NMSM):** The proposed venue, located at **Larry Blind's school/Berna Facco facility**, is connected to an entity, the **New Mexico School of Music (NMSM)**, whose directors' alleged actions led to my formal complaint of a **"violation of the MTNA code of ethics"**.
*   **Alienating Local Teachers:** The conflict is compounded by aggressive local advertising, likely associated with NMSM, claiming to have the **"#1 Music Faculty... in Albuquerque"** [Previous Communication History]. This harms the local professional community, and hosting the official Board meeting at a facility tied to this advertising risks further alienating the very Albuquerque teachers who already show resistance to state-level participation, reflected in the EST's observation that members in Albuquerque **"won't even drive 2 miles to the event!!"**.

### Formal Agenda Request

Pursuant to the Bylaws, I formally request that the Board of Directors include the following critical items on the agenda for the November 7–8 meeting:

1.  **Resolution for Mandatory Digital Meeting Accessibility (Zoom Mandate).**
2.  **Resolution on Fiduciary Compliance and Mandatory Officer Access to Financial Records.**
3.  **Resolution for a Vote of No Confidence Regarding the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST).**
4.  **Review of Ethical Conflicts and Venue Selection** (to address documented conflicts of interest and harm to the member community).

I urge the Board to prioritize these resolutions to safeguard PMTNM's integrity and future viability.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
