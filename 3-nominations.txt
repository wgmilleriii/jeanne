1) Submission and acknowledgment (Email)
- 2024-10-10 4:46 PM — Chip to Jeanne (nomination submitted):
  "Hi Jeanne,
  I would like to nominate Terri for this award.
  I added two sheets to the PDF for her education and experience, they are also included.
  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!
  Chip"

- 2024-10-10 4:56 PM — Jeanne to Chip (acknowledgment and process note):
  "Hi, Chip,
  Thanks for the documents and nomination of TERRI RECK as 2025 Teacher of the Year (TOY). She’s certainly a worthy candidate.
  As I recall the TOY nominations traditionally are presented at the April Board meeting. At that time Board members vote and the selection is made.
  All best,
  Jeanne"

2) Board meeting deliberation highlights (Transcript excerpts)
- 1:36:21 — Sharon: "Do we have nominations for the Teacher of the Year?"
- 1:38:21 — Chip: "You replied to it in October." (re: the email nomination)
- 1:38:29 — Jeanne: "But that was for last year."
- 1:38:32 — Chip: "It says 2025, teacher of the year nomination."

Process objections and attempts to delay or divert
- 1:36:26–1:38:19 — Jeanne shifts to discussing past recipients and directories before returning to current nomination discussion.
- 1:40:39 — Jeanne: "Don't you think we all have to look at the recommendation and then vote?"
- 1:40:43–1:40:45 — Jeanne: "We can vote by email. That's how we did last year."
- 1:44:47–1:45:31 — Jeanne notes email update issues and asks procedural questions (duplicate nominations, frequency), while Sharon moves toward concluding the nomination and taking a vote.

Negative characterization of the nominee’s record (quoted)
- 1:39:17 — Jeanne: "I believe the reason Teri Resch was not nominated last time was she has not contributed very much to community service."
  - Immediate responses from others include multiple supportive statements of Terri’s contributions (e.g., 1:39:32 Janna; 1:39:36–1:40:00 and 1:43:02–1:43:54 Chip detailing roles, service, and activities).

Motion and proceeding toward a vote
- 1:40:05 — Chip: "I would like to make a motion for Teri Resch."
- 1:40:12 — Jeanne clarifies: "Teacher of the Year for 2025."
- 1:40:54 — Lori: "I second it."
- 1:41:20–1:43:46 — Chip reads the nomination details and contributions into the record upon Sharon’s request.
- 1:44:47 — Jeanne: "Okay, so we have a nomination for Terry Reck with the documentation, and the nomination read."
- 1:45:31 — Sharon: Moves to complete the nomination and call for the vote: "All those in favor, say aye."

3) Synthesis
- The nomination was submitted and acknowledged by email on 2024-10-10 with Jeanne calling Terri a "worthy candidate."
- During the board meeting, Jeanne repeatedly questioned timing and procedure (e.g., suggesting it was “last year,” proposing deferral to email voting, and raising directory/history and duplication questions) while others moved to hear the nomination and vote in-meeting.
- Jeanne also asserted that Terri "has not contributed very much to community service"; several members immediately cited Terri’s specific PMTNM contributions and roles in response.
- The board proceeded with a motion, a second, the reading of supporting documentation, and a call to vote.
