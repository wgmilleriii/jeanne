Do you have the listing for a mass mailing to the membership? I want to send them a New Year's greeting and plans for the year.</div>

  <div class="body">Here is data from the old site. I also shared a Google sheet with you ‚Ä¶

I think we need to reach out to national to get the updated list though. This is a start but it has not been updated for a long time as I understand. Jeanne, can you do that?</div>

  <div class="body">Thank you, Jeanne. Where is it? 

Or are you simply verifying that the attachment is accurate as of today?

Do you have an email from MTNA with the current membership or are you confirming that the MTNA does not distribute this information to state leadership? 
Is MTNA aware of our current leadership? 

Please clarify and provide more information. Thank you, Jeanne!</div>

  <div class="sub">From: Jeanne Grealish ‚Üí To: Chip Miller ‚Ä¢ Subject: Answers to questions</div>
  <div class="body">Chip, below in red I‚Äôve tried to address your concerns. If I‚Äôve missed anything, please let me know.  

    And, here are a few thoughts to be considered ‚Ä¶ or not:
    
        According to the official job descriptions found in the PMTNM Bylaws and Handbook we each have our own tasks to perform. When we adhere to these things run smoothly. When there is too much overlapping or unintentional  assumption of tasks it can become annoying and lead to much confusion and/or false information. End result: annoyed folks become reluctant to assume chairmanships or other positions in the organization, a result PMTNM cannot afford. Irrelevant emails or calls simply never help.
    
         Similarly, the national MTNA office staff has plenty to do without misinformed contact or non-relevant local concerns expressed by individuals; MTNA deals with concerns at a national level. It's a small staff handling national governance via administrative staff and national Board; the Summit for state presidents; national financial and membership records; all publications; and every detail of the national conference: planning, preparation, registrations, competitions, etc. 
    
         Since  you are new to PMTNM perhaps you are not aware of the above facts. We all appreciate your enthusiasm and desire to help improve the organization. Serving in any office is usually a ‚Äúlearn as you go‚Äù process; certainly holding my office has been so over the years and continues to be‚Ä¶ üôÇ
    
    All best,
    Jeanne

  <div class="body">Hi Jeanne, do you have a copy of the handbook? It would be great if everybody had access to it! So sad that it has been unavailable for years! Would you send me a copy? I'll add it to the website. I know that would help a lot. It would be great if all had a copy rather than email going out referencing something that only a few people have had access to. How confusing! Also, what is this misinformed contact you to referenced? Please clarify.   Thanks, Chip</div>

It's a good thing we're getting this cleaned up. Thank you for your help! Please do email me a copy.

  <div class="body">...
The other item that was never added to the website is the Handbook ‚Äì primarily because the existing complete Handbook is horribly out of date. The Student Activities section of the Handbook is online as it has undergone edits as needed through the years.

Best regards,
