Subject: Request for guidance and brief on PMTNM governance concerns and member resources
          </div>
        </header>

        <main>
          <p>Dear Mr. Shepard,</p>

          <p>
            I’m writing to request a brief meeting with you for an outside perspective on governance and member-support issues I have encountered this past year while serving as Vice President of the Professional Music Teachers of New Mexico (PMTNM). I remain committed to supporting our members and building resources that help teachers and students. I would be grateful for your guidance on constructive next steps.
          </p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to core documents (Handbook, membership list, minutes, financials) has been inconsistent or absent, impacting role clarity and timely reporting.</li>
            <li>My 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination was repeatedly framed as “last year” in discussion despite documentation stating 2025.</li>
            <li>Financial reporting cadence and shared access need alignment with Handbook standards to support officers’ duties.</li>
            <li>One internal reply to an MTNA Foundation message was dismissive, disruptive, and discouraging; I seek norms to ensure communications reflect MTNA values as this one in particular appears the most contradictory to our Code of Ethics “The teacher is encouraged to be a resource in the community”.</li>
            <li>Ask: a short call, suggested remedies, and any MTNA templates/checklists we can adopt.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Context and contributions</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past year I have focused on rebuilding our website’s resource library so members can access accurate information and shared materials more easily. The work has been energizing and I am eager to keep that positive momentum, and would like to share this work with you. Despite the obstacles I have faced, I have kept the member's interests at heart and would like to share this work with you.
          </p>

          <h2>Key issues and documentation (chronological)</h2>

          <h3>1) Handbook access and clarity of roles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I requested the PMTNM Handbook to ensure my actions align with our duties. Relevant emails:
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-09-1707-jeanne" target="handbookpane">“Answers to questions” (Jan 9, 2025)</a>,
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2024-12-13-1148-larry" target="handbookpane">“RE: PMTNM 2025” (Dec 13, 2024)</a>.
              I was able to obtain a copy only after much effort, from Ferrell Roberts and scanned it (Email: “PEP issue”, 2025-02-26). The delay affected role clarity and timely execution of duties. Handbook policy notes:

              <code>One copy of the PMTNM HANDBOOK is furnished to each new member of PMTNM. Revisions and additions will be sent to members periodically. Please keep your handbook up to date.  
                Replacement or additional copies of the PMTNM HANDBOOK may be had by writing to the current PMTNM Handbook Chairman or the PMTNM Executive Secretary-Treasurer.
                </code>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2) Membership list access and reporting</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I supplied legacy data and asked for the current list to fulfill outreach duties.
              Related emails:
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-06-1033-sharon" target="handbookpane">“Membership mailing” (Jan 6, 2025)</a>,
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-07-1416-chip" target="handbookpane">“Re: Membership mailing” (Jan 7, 2025)</a>,
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-07-2311-jeanne" target="handbookpane">Reply (Jan 7, 2025)</a>.
              In the spring board meeting, <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#" target="handbookpane">when asked for a membership report</a>, I explained I did not have the current list; <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#no-membership-list-confirmation" target="handbookpane">another board member confirmed she did not have it either</a>. This impeded basic membership work and accurate reporting.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3) Teacher of the Year nomination process</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I submitted a 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination by email and received an acknowledgement. <a href=board_meeting_transcription.html#teacher-of-the-year-nomination target="handbookpane">In the board meeting discussion</a>, the nomination was repeatedly framed as “last year,” despite the 2025 designation. A suggestion was made to delay to email voting. There was also a statement minimizing the nominee’s community service , countered immediately by specific service contributions on the record. The nomination proceeded to a motion, second, documentation reading, and a call for a vote.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4) Financial information requests and Handbook standards</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>On 2025-03-17, I requested full financial details “per handbook guidelines” to prepare for the April review and to align VP duties with budgeting and reporting (<a href="financials.html#msg-2025-03-17-1256-chip" target="handbookpane">see request</a>).</li>
            <li>The response indicated the 2024–2025 budget had been approved in November; that current financial reports are shared with the Board and membership; and that review would take place at the April Board meeting (<a href="financials.html#msg-2025-03-17-1529-jeanne" target="handbookpane">see response</a>).</li>
            <li>Information supplied at the board meeting was insufficient. See <a href="financialreport.jpeg" target="handbookpane">financial report</a>.</li>
            <li>Relevant Handbook duties: <code>O. Has the financial records, CPA's reports, check book, receipts, and vouchers available prior to the conference for inspection by the Auditing Committee. The records should be open to any member at all times.  </code></li>
            <li>I’m seeking a predictable cadence and a shared repository for financial reports consistent with those standards so officers can perform their roles effectively.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5) Budget committee participation and cadence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I understand the VP is on the Budget Planning Committee supposed to meet in August (<a href="financials.html#august" target="handbookpane">see response</a>). We have not met.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6) Minutes distribution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The Handbook describes timely circulation and filing of conference and board minutes and indicates copies should be sent to members within a set timeframe. I have not been able to locate recent minutes in the organization’s accessible archives; having them would help align actions with decisions.
                <code>c. The Executive Secretary-Treasurer shall be responsible for keeping minutes of all business meetings of the Association and meetings of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors, sends copies of the minutes of the meetings to the members within 60 days after the meetings, and sees that those minutes are in legal form and properly preserved in a permanent Minute Book, and such other duties as are assigned by the Board of Directors.</code>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>7) Foundation communications</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After I circulated an MTNA Foundation appeal to members, I received a reply stating, “Boring and irrelevant to most of us.” (Email: “Re: PMTNM | MTNA | The Foundation”, 2025-09-11 18:29). I appreciate different priorities across volunteer leaders, and I’m seeking guidance on professional norms for framing fundraising communications so they consistently reflect MTNA’s values. <a href="boring.pdf" target="handbookpane">see response</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Requested outcomes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A brief conversation to sanity-check whether these patterns reflect typical growing pains or signal governance processes that would benefit from MTNA-aligned corrective steps.</li>
            <li>Suggestions for constructive remedies that support: timely access to core documents (handbook, minutes, membership list), clear nomination procedures, budget/reporting cadence, and professional internal communications.</li>
            <li>Any MTNA resources or exemplars (checklists, timelines, role handbooks) that PMTNM can adopt to reduce friction and ensure we’re meeting standards.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I’m happy to share supporting excerpts (email subjects/dates; transcript references) or provide a short packet upon request.
          </p>



          <h2>Personal reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Were this a place of employment, I would have left long ago. Awareness of my ability to provide some service of value to my fellow teachers has been the driving force in keeping me here.
          </p>
          > Presonal reflections
          The intervening time between requesting a copy of the handbook , and actually not receiving one except through Ferrell Roberts , is bewildering. 
          How the secretery can claim that resources have been online, and simply not distribute the handbook at a request, is bewildering.
          How the secretery can claim that online material (membership list) is out of date and not send a corrected list at a request, is bewildering.
          How the secretery can attempt to thwart a nomination is bewildering.
          How the secretery can ignore a request for financial information is bewildering.
          How the secretery is getting paid is bewildering. 
          
          There have been no minutes dispered since the last board meeting (Spring [date needed]) . The handbook states 60 days [cite]
          
          ---
          
          
          Were this a place of employment, I would have left long ago. Awareness of my ability to provide some service of value to my fellow teachers has been the driving force in keeping me here.
          
          I am truly excited about the resources section of the website and the potential it has to connect us together in a wholesome manner, becoming resources not just for ourselves in New Mexico, but available immediately to others online in their own musical journeys. I wish to focus on that now.
          
          <p>
            My intent is not to criticize individuals, but to strengthen processes so volunteers can do their best work on behalf of teachers and students. Thank you for considering this request. I would welcome any time you can offer. I’m available most weekdays between 9–11 a.m. Mountain or 3–5 p.m. Mountain.
