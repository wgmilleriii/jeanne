          <p>Dear Mr. Shepard,</p>

          <p>
            I am writing to you with an ethical complaint against Jeanne Grealish and am asking for mediation.
          </p>

          <p>
            This issue is sensitive and I would prefer to discuss it in person before its distribution or escalation to Jeanne. 
            I recognize that Jeanne has contributed to, and been recognized by, MTNA. From my perspective, her actions are not reflective of the values of MTNA; they have hurt not only my individual progress, but the progress of the organization. I do not know if Jeanne has "bought" her position with her financial contributions to MTNA, and whether that purchase (if any) includes immunity from ethical scrutiny and a permanent position despite the handbook's statement <code>• Section 2. All officers shall be elected annually, and may be eligible for re-election, except the Executive Secretary-Treasurer who shall be appointed by the Executive Committee (those officers listed under Section 1) for a <mark>two-year term</mark>, and may be eligible for reappointment.</code>
            Jeanne has been Executive Treasurer-Secretary since 1996, according to all known sources.
          </p>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to core documents (Handbook, membership list, minutes, financials) has been inconsistent or absent, impacting role clarity and timely reporting.</li>
            
            <li>My 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination was repeatedly framed as “last year” in discussion despite documentation stating 2025.</li>
            <li>Financial reporting cadence and shared access need alignment with Handbook standards to support officers’ duties.</li>
            <li>Her final internal reply to an MTNA Foundation message was dismissive, disruptive, and discouraging; I seek norms to ensure communications reflect MTNA values as this one in particular appears the most contradictory to our Code of Ethics “The teacher is encouraged to be a resource in the community”.</li>
            <li>Ask: a short call, suggested remedies, and any MTNA templates/checklists we can adopt, including oversight of the nomination committee and procedure for placing another member in the position of secretary.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key issues and documentation (chronological)</h2>

          <h3>1) Handbook access and clarity of roles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I requested the PMTNM Handbook to ensure my actions align with our duties. Relevant emails:
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-09-1707-jeanne" target="handbookpane">“Answers to questions” (Jan 9, 2025)</a>
              .
              I was able to obtain a copy only after much effort, from Ferrell Roberts and scanned it (see  <a href="janna.html" target="handbookpane">correspondence with Janna</a>). The delay affected role clarity and timely execution of duties. Handbook policy notes:

              <div class="code-block"><code>One copy of the PMTNM HANDBOOK is furnished to each new member of PMTNM. Revisions and additions will be sent to members periodically. Please keep your handbook up to date.
Replacement or additional copies of the PMTNM HANDBOOK may be had by writing to the current PMTNM Handbook Chairman or the PMTNM Executive Secretary-Treasurer.</code></div>
            </li>

            
            <ul>
                      <li>
                        A new member <a href="priscilla.html" target="handbookpane">confirmed no contact</a> from the secretary.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
          </ul>

          <h3>2) Membership list access and reporting</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I supplied legacy data and asked for the current list to fulfill outreach duties.
              Related emails:
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-06-1033-sharon" target="handbookpane">“Membership mailing” (Jan 6, 2025)</a>,
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-07-1416-chip" target="handbookpane">“Re: Membership mailing” (Jan 7, 2025)</a>,
              <a href="HandbookEmails.html#msg-2025-01-07-2311-jeanne" target="handbookpane">Reply (Jan 7, 2025)</a>.
              In the spring board meeting, <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#" target="handbookpane">when asked for a membership report</a>, I explained I did not have the current list; <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#no-membership-list-confirmation" target="handbookpane">another board member confirmed she did not have it either</a>. This impeded basic membership work and accurate reporting.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3) Teacher of the Year nomination process</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I submitted a 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination by email and received an acknowledgement. <a href=board_meeting_transcription.html#teacher-of-the-year-nomination target="handbookpane">In the board meeting discussion</a>, the nomination was repeatedly framed as “last year,” despite the 2025 designation. A suggestion was made to delay to email voting. There was also a statement minimizing the nominee’s community service , countered immediately by specific service contributions on the record. The nomination proceeded to a motion, second, documentation reading, and a call for a vote.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4) Financial information requests and Handbook standards</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>On 2025-03-17, I requested full financial details “per handbook guidelines” to prepare for the April review and to align VP duties with budgeting and reporting (<a href="financials.html#msg-2025-03-17-1256-chip" target="handbookpane">see request</a>).</li>
            <li>The response indicated the 2024–2025 budget had been approved in November; that current financial reports are shared with the Board and membership; and that review would take place at the April Board meeting (<a href="financials.html#msg-2025-03-17-1529-jeanne" target="handbookpane">see response</a>).</li>
            <li>Information supplied at the board meeting was insufficient. See <a href="financialreport.jpeg" target="handbookpane">financial report</a>.</li>
            <li>Relevant Handbook duties: <div class="code-block"><code>O. Has the financial records, CPA's reports, check book, receipts, and vouchers available prior to the conference for inspection by the Auditing Committee. The records should be open to any member at all times.</code></div></li>
            <li>I’m seeking a predictable cadence and a shared repository for financial reports consistent with those standards so officers can perform their roles effectively.</li>
            <li><b>I will be reaching out again to Jeanne for financial information in accordance with the handbook, and request 
              oversight from MTNA on this process.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5) Budget committee participation and cadence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I understand the VP is on the Budget Planning Committee supposed to meet in August (<a href="financials.html#august" target="handbookpane">see response</a>). We have not met.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6) Minutes distribution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The Handbook describes timely circulation and filing of conference and board minutes and indicates copies should be sent to members within a set timeframe. I have not been able to locate recent minutes in the organization’s accessible archives; our organization has no archivisthaving them would help align actions with decisions.
                <div class="code-block"><code>c. The Executive Secretary-Treasurer shall be responsible for keeping minutes of all business meetings of the Association and meetings of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors, sends copies of the minutes of the meetings to the members within 60 days after the meetings, and sees that those minutes are in legal form and properly preserved in a permanent Minute Book, and such other duties as are assigned by the Board of Directors.</code></div>

                <div class="code-block"><code>
                  ARTICLE IX - ARCHIVIST
                  
                  * Section 1. The President appoints an Archivist, with the approval of the Executive Board, to serve until a successor is named. The Archivist is an ex-officio member of the Executive Board.  
                  * Section 2. Duties of the Archivist are to collect and keep in secure place all items of historical interest to the Association, including programs, pertinent newspaper and magazine articles, photographs and correspondence.
                  </code></div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>7) Foundation communications</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After I circulated an MTNA Foundation appeal to members, I received a reply stating, “Boring and irrelevant to most of us.” I appreciate different priorities across volunteer leaders, and I’m seeking guidance on professional norms for framing fundraising communications so they consistently reflect MTNA’s values. <a href="boring.pdf" target="handbookpane">see response</a></li>
          </ul>

        <h3>8) Additional financial and community impacts</h3>
        <ul><li>During the board meeting, the <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#additional-financial-impacts-on-the-community" target="handbookpane">president confirmed she had done no advertising</a>; none of the other board members offered any fundraising efforts; many of these people have been in the community for years. <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#additional-financial-impacts-on-the-community" target="handbookpane">A board member attempts at understanding contributions remains unanswered</a>;</li> my request for scholarship information <a href="financials.html#msg-2025-03-17-1601-sharon" target="handbookpane">received a dismissive reply</a>. There has not been a printed community directory for many years, possibly since 2016; <a href="board_meeting_transcription.html#on-the-directory-printed-and-online" target="handbookpane">requests for a directory, even from the president, were dismissed</a>.
        
        <b>It is apparent that efforts of the community to fundraise and communicate with each other
        have been affected by a lack of commitment, and a lack of transparency.</b>
        </ul>
          <h2>Requested outcomes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A brief conversation to sanity-check whether these patterns reflect typical growing pains or signal governance processes that would benefit from MTNA-aligned corrective steps.</li>
            <li>Suggestions for constructive remedies that support: timely access to core documents (handbook, minutes, membership list), clear nomination procedures, budget/reporting cadence, and professional internal communications.</li>
            <li>Any MTNA resources or exemplars (checklists, timelines, role handbooks) that PMTNM can adopt to reduce friction and ensure we’re meeting standards.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Please let me know if you would like me to provide any additional information.
          </p>


          <h2>Personal reflection</h2>
          <p>Were this a place of employment, I would have left long ago. Awareness of my ability to provide some service of value to my fellow teachers has been the driving force in keeping me here.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The prolonged gap between requesting the Handbook and obtaining a copy only via Ferrell Roberts is bewildering.</li>


            <li>How the secretary can claim that resources have been online, and simply not distribute the handbook at a request, is bewildering.</li>
            <li>How the secretary can claim that online material (membership list) was out of date and not send a corrected list at a request, is bewildering.</li>
            <li>How the secretary can grossly attempt to thwart a nomination is bewildering.</li>
            <li>How the secretary can ignore a request for financial information is bewildering.</li>
            <li>How the secretary is <a href="thank-you-and-requests.html#msg-2025-04-19-1329-sharon" target="handbookpane">receiving financial compensation for her position</a> is bewildering.</li>



          </ul>
          
          <p>I remain focused on constructive solutions and on building resources that help our members and students.</p>
          
          <p>
            My intent is not to criticize individuals, but to strengthen processes so volunteers can do their best work on behalf of teachers and students. Thank you for considering this request. I would welcome any time you can offer.
