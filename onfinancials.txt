Jeanne, please refer to my last email to you and respond with your opinion regarding website content. 
[jeanne]My opinion has n0t changed. The old website was attractive. 
[chip]Please confer with Sharon on all website content requests. Please send me information on setting up new scholarships. This is not your territory. It is that of the Board.

The 2024-2025 budget was approved last November by the Board and membership. Current financial reports are shared with all Board members and the membership. Review will take place at the April Board meeting. The VP is on the Budget planning committee which does its work in August and has no function beyond that.  All Board members and general membership are treated equally. The CPA watches over PMTNM and its financial details.

Thank you,

Chip
