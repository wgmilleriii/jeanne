on membership and foundation reports
==


[Sharon] (1:01 - 1:21)
Chip, let's see. Let's see. Here's...

Yeah, and we need your... Supposed to have a foundation report. I've emailed you that you're in charge of the foundation and membership.

Do you have a membership report?

[Chip] (1:22 - 1:26)
I would love to get a membership list, and then I could contact those people. Can I get a membership list?

[Jeanne] (1:26 - 1:28)
You should have a membership list.

[Chip] (1:28 - 1:28)
How would I?

[Jeanne] (1:28 - 1:29)
Yeah.

[Chip] (1:32 - 1:38)
I thought that you would have sent me a membership list, or should I just email that to reply to everybody?

[Jeanne] (1:38 - 1:40)
The membership list is supposed to be online.

[Chip] (1:41 - 1:49)
I think you've missed a lot of emails, but maybe you could send me a membership list, or after this we could get a membership list.

[Sharon] (1:49 - 1:52)
Well, we all have membership lists. I do.

[Jeanne] (1:52 - 1:53)
Do you, Janna?



[Janna] (1:53 - 1:53)
No.

[Sharon] (1:53 - 1:54)
No, okay.

[Jeanne] (1:54 - 2:03)
Well, we're...

It's a coming-as-an-item. All right. Here we go.

A conference. Any other reports? We have a treasurer's report....

on teacher of the year nomination 
=====

[Sharon] (1:36:21 - 1:36:24)
Do we have nominations for the Teacher of the Year?

[Jeanne] (1:36:26 - 1:36:39)
But I saw... Did Larry Blind, was he a Teacher of the Year in the past years?

And we have his... Larry Blind. He has been a teacher.

[Speaker 7] (1:36:39 - 1:36:39)
Has he been?

[Jeanne] (1:36:40 - 1:38:20)
Okay. It's on that list. Let's change to the list.

Yes, it is. Do you know when he was a Teacher of the Year? Was the year before or after you?

The year before. Pardon? Before me?

Mm-hmm. Madeleine Williamson was old in 2019. Oh, no.

Before me. Oh, this one. In 2021.

In 2021? Yes, it was... I don't remember what happened in the last year.

Lower documents. Thank you. This is for...

Young Indians can say by name. And, yeah, in 2021. Think about it.

Okay, I need to... I can actually try to check it, yeah. I don't know this lady very well.

She was older, but I remember she was nominated. Yeah, we need to know who... Because in 2020, there was no award made.

In 2019, it was Madeleine Williamson. In 2024, it was Tatiana Bee. And she still has her plaque.

In 2023, it was Tatiana Bee. In 2022, it was you. They're all listed in the back of the directory.

From the beginning of time, they're listed in the back of the directory? Except the ones that are here. This is an old directory.

ICF-21, 22. Yeah.

[Chip] (1:38:21 - 1:38:23)
You replied to it in October.

[Jeanne] (1:38:24 - 1:38:25)
Well, that was last year.

[Chip] (1:38:25 - 1:38:29)
It's October of 2024. That's the teacher of the year nomination.

[Jeanne] (1:38:29 - 1:38:31)
But that was for last year.

[Chip] (1:38:32 - 1:38:36)
It says 2025, teacher of the year nomination.

[Sharon] (1:38:36 - 1:38:37)
And then it should...

[Jeanne] (1:38:37 - 1:38:42)
What are the responses to it?

[Sharon] (1:38:49 - 1:39:17)
Farrell was 2010.

2012 was Rebecca Carone. 2013, no award made. 2014, Heather Nassi.

2015, Diane Brower-Bailey, who has passed away. 2016, Doris Tangersud, who has passed away. 2017, no award made.

Okay, to Teri Resch.

[Jeanne] (1:39:17 - 1:39:30)
I believe the reason Teri Resch was not nominated last time was she has not contributed very much to community service. Okay.



[Janna] (1:39:32 - 1:39:33)
But she's a good contributor.

[Chip] (1:39:36 - 1:39:46)
She taught such a wonderful workshop at the conference last year. At the 2023 conference, she did the bowl with the children.

[Sharon] (1:39:47 - 1:39:49)
She did it for a while, the student activities.

[Chip] (1:39:49 - 1:40:01)
She was a chair. 2023. Yeah, she did it for a while.

She also made things to sell, to raise money for the organization. She's contributed quite a lot.

[Sharon] (1:40:02 - 1:40:05)
Do you want to make a motion right now?

[Chip] (1:40:05 - 1:40:07)
I would like to make a motion for Teri Resch.

[Jeanne] (1:40:07 - 1:40:08)
To be what?

[Chip] (1:40:08 - 1:40:09)
Teacher of the Year.

[Jeanne] (1:40:09 - 1:40:11)
Teacher of the Year for 2025.

[Chip] (1:40:12 - 1:40:12)
That's correct.

[Sharon] (1:40:12 - 1:40:19)
And then can you submit as written... We'll vote now, but then submit as written documentation.

[Chip] (1:40:19 - 1:40:23)
I've already done that. It's in your email and it's in Gene's email.

[Sharon] (1:40:24 - 1:40:25)
As of now?

[Jeanne] (1:40:25 - 1:40:27)
That was last year.

[Chip] (1:40:28 - 1:40:29)
It's in your email.

[Sharon] (1:40:29 - 1:40:30)
Well, if it wasn't...

[Chip] (1:40:30 - 1:40:32)
Right now, I just sent it. You just sent it now.

[Sharon] (1:40:33 - 1:40:33)
Okay.

[Chip] (1:40:33 - 1:40:37)
Thank you. I did, I just sent it.

[Sharon] (1:40:37 - 1:40:38)
Alright, well now we will have a vote.

[Jeanne] (1:40:39 - 1:40:42)
Don't you think we all have to look at the recommendation and then vote?

[Sharon] (1:40:42 - 1:40:42)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:40:43 - 1:40:46)
We can vote by email. That's how we did last year.

[Sharon] (1:40:46 - 1:40:47)
Is that how we did last year?



[Janna] (1:40:47 - 1:40:50)
Laurie, do you hear? You see, so just Teri Resch.

[Lori] (1:40:51 - 1:40:53)
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

[Janna] (1:40:53 - 1:40:54)
Good idea.

[Lori] (1:40:54 - 1:40:56)
I second it.



[Janna] (1:40:57 - 1:40:57)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:41:01 - 1:41:03)
And vote for...

[Sharon] (1:41:05 - 1:41:08)
Do you have paper ready to read or something?

[Chip] (1:41:08 - 1:41:11)
Yes, ma'am.

[Sharon] (1:41:15 - 1:41:17)
Yeah, let's get this done now.

[Chip] (1:41:18 - 1:41:20)
Would you like me to read it?

[Sharon] (1:41:20 - 1:41:20)
Yes, please.

[Jeanne] (1:41:20 - 1:41:21)
Or would you like to read it? No, read it.

[Chip] (1:41:21 - 1:42:27)

======
on getting a directory 
======

[Sharon] (1:45:23 - 1:45:24)
No, just once?

[Jeanne] (1:45:24 - 1:48:46)
Yeah, I think once. We have lots of people who really deserve it. No, I just, yeah, just check.

All those, let's have a nomination and complete this. I've got other things. All those in favor, say aye.

Aye. Opposed? Okay.

Now, Terry Reck is our 2025 Teacher of the Year. Did you want to send her an email, Gene, or do you want me to? I think it would be nice if it came from the President.

Okay. I'm willing to do it. Yeah, no, no, I will.

Yeah. Okay, that is completed. 

[sharon]
Okay, also for the directory, we've had information, people asking for a new directory.
And I think we have the funds, don't we, where we could afford to have a directory, Gene? The directory's not so expensive to print. It is expensive to mail.


So, I mean, it would be a matter of taking a sample to the post office and ask them now what the postage would be. 

[Jeanne]
But it was something like 90 cents the last time we mailed them out. And postage has gone up.

[Sharon]
Yeah. Maybe we can keep it. I'm sorry.

[Jeanne]
No, maybe we can, you can just keep it for conference and we can pick it up. We don't have to send it. Then it would be out of date.

No, in November. Is there an online directory? Well, supposedly, the equivalent of the directory is on the website.

I have no luck with it, and I find MT&A people. And it's true, some people have asked for a printed directory. They like having it in hand, and I understand that.

But I'm lucky, Pierre, who gets to put it together. At this point, memberships are beginning to renew for next year. So in preparing the printed directory in the past, we've waited until about December to put everything together, because then we have a pretty accurate record of who's going to join.

Because if you print it too soon, you leave out people. 

[sharon]

Right, right. And then you have to send out an addendum.


[jeanne]
So in November, we can have kind of, you will know better, and we can pick it up. Or, Ivanov's suggestion, you can, for example, to Santa Fe, you don't need to send everyone. You can just send it to me, and we'll distribute it.

And just give them personally, and it's all safe for postage. Like in Los Alamos, send it to Wendy and she'll... 

[sharon] 
So you're saying, have the directory ready by the 9th of November?

[jeanne]
Well, actually, by then, most of the members would be in. Will that be the time to distribute it? It is, but it's a question of getting it.

It takes time to put it together, the formatting.

[Sam] (1:48:49 - 1:48:54)
I understand. Who maintains the online directory?

[Chip] (1:48:54 - 1:48:55)
MT&A.

[Sam] (1:48:55 - 1:48:58)
Who maintains the online directory?

[Jeanne] (1:48:58 - 1:49:28)
MT&A does not maintain our online directory. MT&A is the online... MT&A has all our information, but they don't have what's in our directory.

Our directory has a list of all our past presidents, all our past Teachers of the Year, our Code of Ethics. There's more in there than just a list of members, which is what MT&A has.

[Sam] (1:49:28 - 1:49:35)
But when people request a hard copy, they're looking for everybody's phone number, basically, right? E-mail.

[Jeanne] (1:49:36 - 1:50:03)
For example, if I'm talking on the phone to somebody and they'll say, I'm moving and is there a teacher there in Las Cruces? Well, you can tell them to go look on that. But if it's at the moment, I always have mine right over there on my desk, and so if I need to find something, or a teacher here in Albuquerque.

Right. Who live in Bartalas? When I start to search for...

Okay, I see. Who live in Bartalas? They say Bartalas.

Who live in Bartalas?

[Sharon] (1:50:03 - 1:50:04)
Well, we'll just hire it.

[Jeanne] (1:50:04 - 1:50:29)
Our printed directory, Sam, also has all the teachers in Albuquerque. It has teachers by town and community. And districts.

Albuquerque is in the districts. And MT&A could call that up for you, but that's not MT&A's business. They're running the national...

I mean, nationally, who's a member.

[Sam] (1:50:29 - 1:50:32)
And how much of that information is on the online directory?

[Jeanne] (1:50:34 - 1:50:39)
The online directory, when the website is functioning well, it's all there.

[Sam] (1:50:40 - 1:50:50)
Okay. And there's probably not too many people who need a hard copy, but if there are a few, sending it to just the ones who request it would not be expensive.

[Jeanne] (1:50:53 - 1:51:12)
It's a question of, is it worth going to the trouble to do that for five or six people? Because it is time-consuming to put this together. Definitely.

[janna]
I'm sorry, I need to leave. I have teaching. Oh, okay.

I'm driving one hour. Oh, yes, yes. Well, thank you.

[Chip] (1:51:12 - 1:51:14)
Thank you for coming all the way down.

[Jeanne] (1:51:14 - 1:51:36)
I think you have... It's good to see you. Thank you.
