Subject: Request for guidance and brief on PMTNM governance concerns and member resources

Dear Mr. Shepard,

I’m writing to request a brief meeting with you for an outside perspective on governance and member-support issues I have encountered this past year while serving as Vice President of the Professional Music Teachers of New Mexico (PMTNM). I remain committed to supporting our members and building resources that help teachers and students. I would be grateful for your guidance on constructive next steps.

Executive summary (1–2 minutes)
- Access to core documents (Handbook, membership list, minutes, financials) has been inconsistent or absent, impacting role clarity and timely reporting.
- A 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination was repeatedly framed as “last year” in discussion despite documentation stating 2025.
- Financial reporting cadence and shared access need alignment with Handbook standards to support officers’ duties.
- One internal reply to an MTNA Foundation message was dismissive, disruptive, and discouraging; I seek norms to ensure communications reflect MTNA values as this one in particular appears the most contradictory to our Code of Ethics “The teacher is encouraged to be a resource in the community”.
- Ask: a short call, suggested remedies, and any MTNA templates/checklists we can adopt.

Context and contributions
Over the past year I have focused on rebuilding our website’s resource library so members can access accurate information and shared materials more easily. The work has been energizing and I am eager to keep that positive momentum. Alongside that, several recurring workflow and access issues have affected my ability to fulfill VP duties. I’m summarizing them below with concise citations, so you can see the pattern and help me calibrate a professional path forward.

Key issues and documentation (chronological)
1) Handbook access and clarity of roles (see Handbook1.html)
- I requested the PMTNM Handbook to ensure my actions align with our duties. I was told it was online (Email: “Answers to questions”, 2025-01-09), but the prior webmaster wrote that the complete Handbook was never added to the site (Email: “RE: PMTNM 2025”, 2024-12-13). I was able to obtain a copy only after much effort, from Ferrell Roberts and scanned it (Email: “PEP issue”, 2025-02-26). The delay affected role clarity and timely execution of duties. Handbook policy notes each new member should receive a copy and that revisions are sent periodically (handbook_full.txt L17–18).

2) Membership list access and reporting
- I supplied legacy data and asked for the current list to fulfill outreach duties (Email: “Membership mailing”, 2025-01-06; Email: “Re: Membership mailing”, 2025-01-07). In a board meeting, when asked for a membership report, I explained I did not have the current list; another board member confirmed she did not have it either (01-membership.txt L18–46). This impeded basic membership work and accurate reporting.

3) Teacher of the Year nomination process
- I submitted a 2025 Teacher of the Year nomination by email and received an acknowledgement (Email on 2024-10-10). In the board meeting discussion, the nomination was repeatedly framed as “last year,” despite the 2025 designation (nominations-boardmeeting.txt L26–33; timestamps approx. 1:38:24, 1:38:29, 1:40:25). A suggestion was made to delay to email voting (L86–91). There was also a statement minimizing the nominee’s community service (L43), countered immediately by specific service contributions on the record. The nomination proceeded to a motion, second, documentation reading, and a call for a vote.

4) Financial information requests and Handbook standards
- On 2025-03-17, I requested full financial details “per handbook guidelines” to prepare for the April review and to align VP duties with budgeting and reporting (Email on 2025-03-17, subject not captured; see also budget.txt L19).
- The response indicated the 2024–2025 budget had been approved in November; that current financial reports are shared with the Board and membership; and that review would take place at the April Board meeting (Email on 2025-03-17; budget.txt L19).
- Relevant Handbook duties: present financial reports at Executive Board meetings; maintain records open to any member at all times; make CPA reports and financial records available prior to conference for inspection (handbook_full.txt L869–879).
- I’m seeking a predictable cadence and a shared repository for financial reports consistent with those standards so officers can perform their roles effectively.

5) Budget committee participation and cadence
- I understand the VP is on the Budget Planning Committee (budget.txt L19), and the Handbook describes annual budget workflows (handbook_full.txt L989–993). Clarifying meeting timing, inputs, and outputs would reduce friction and improve accountability.

6) Minutes distribution
- The Handbook describes timely circulation and filing of conference and board minutes (handbook_full.txt L865–867) and indicates copies should be sent to members within a set timeframe. I have not been able to locate recent minutes in the organization’s accessible archives; having them would help align actions with decisions.

7) Foundation communications
- After I circulated an MTNA Foundation appeal to members, I received a reply stating, “Boring and irrelevant to most of us.” (Email: “Re: PMTNM | MTNA | The Foundation”, 2025-09-11 18:29). I appreciate different priorities across volunteer leaders, and I’m seeking guidance on professional norms for framing fundraising communications so they consistently reflect MTNA’s values.

Requested outcomes
- A brief conversation to sanity-check whether these patterns reflect typical growing pains or signal governance processes that would benefit from MTNA-aligned corrective steps.
- Suggestions for constructive remedies that support: timely access to core documents (handbook, minutes, membership list), clear nomination procedures, budget/reporting cadence, and professional internal communications.
- Any MTNA resources or exemplars (checklists, timelines, role handbooks) that PMTNM can adopt to reduce friction and ensure we’re meeting standards.

I’m happy to share supporting excerpts (email subjects/dates; transcript references) or provide a short packet upon request.

My intent is not to criticize individuals, but to strengthen processes so volunteers can do their best work on behalf of teachers and students. Thank you for considering this request. I would welcome any time you can offer. I’m available most weekdays between 9–11 a.m. Mountain or 3–5 p.m. Mountain.

With appreciation,

Chip Miller
