  <div class="body">What is the date on the Handbook you received?

My opinion has not changed. The old website was attractive.

The 2024–2025 budget was approved last November by the Board and membership. <strong>Current financial reports are shared with all Board members and the membership.</strong> Review will take place at the April Board meeting. <strong>The VP is on the Budget planning committee</strong> which does its work in August and has no function beyond that. All Board members and general membership are treated equally. The CPA watches over PMTNM and its financial details.</div>
