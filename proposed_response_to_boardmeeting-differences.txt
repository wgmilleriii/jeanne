Legal-safety adjustments compared to proposed_response_to_boardmeeting.txt

1) Removed accusatory and categorical language
- Original: "mandatory financial and governance breaches"; "legally prohibit the organization"; "systematic governance failure"
- New: Framed as "governance and financial process requirements" and "may present governance and fiduciary concerns" to avoid asserting legal conclusions.

2) Replaced definitive claims with requests and observations
- Original asserted noncompliance ("there is no procedurally valid budget", "committee has not met").
- New uses "To my knowledge, the Budget Committee has not convened" and requests scheduling, reducing risk of factual dispute.

3) Removed characterizing quotes that imply intent or misconduct
- Original quoted statements to infer obstruction (e.g., "waste of everyoneâ€™s time", "PMTNM does not function under any legal mandates").
- New omits these to avoid alleging motive; focuses on process steps needed.

4) Shifted from "demands" to "respectful requests"
- Original: "Immediate Demands", "I require", "I must insist".
- New: "Immediate requests", "I respectfully request", maintaining firmness without adversarial tone.

5) Narrowed claims to scope necessary for relief sought
- Removed assertions about "precedent" and "repudiation of governance"; focused on scheduling the Budget Committee, access to records, and agenda placement.

6) Clarified authority references without legal conclusions
- Maintains that bylaws/handbook indicate who is on the Budget Committee and when the budget is presented; avoids stating that actions are "illegal" or "void".

7) Neutralized personal attributions and labels
- Avoids labeling actions as "highly unprofessional" or attributing intent; emphasizes collaboration and compliance.

8) Preserved verifiable, non-defamatory facts and requests
- Dates/events are generalized unless necessary; the letter asks for specific, procedural steps.

Summary: The revised text asserts procedural needs, cites governing documents at a high level, and requests concrete next steps, while avoiding potentially defamatory statements, absolute factual claims that may be contested, and legal conclusions.
