Dear Sharon,

I am writing to you directly and professionally to articulate serious concerns regarding the absence of guidance necessary for me to fulfill the mandated duties of the Vice President and "understudy" role, especially given the impending Board meeting. My attempts to seek clarification on foundational procedural matters have been met with silence or delegation that is fundamentally problematic, leaving me to question how an elected officer is expected to proceed.

Specifically, your silence has compounded the difficulties in three critical areas:

### 1. Lack of Presidential Guidance on Communication and Training

Since assuming office, I have repeatedly sought your assistance in establishing professional conduct and understanding my duties, yet these requests have often been deferred or unanswered.

*   I formally asked you for guidance on my **expectations and responsibilities**.
*   I explicitly requested assistance in drafting communications, asking if you had **"letters from previous VPs anywhere that you could send me as a reference point"** for my first general letter.
*   I informed you in March 2025 that I had **"reviewed the entire handbook and have a list of questions"** regarding foundational terms, but as I later noted, **"You have not responded to that email"**.
*   While you advised that my primary duties as VP are **"collecting funds for the MTNA Foundation and recruiting members,"** stating, **"I will handle other areas"**, this guidance fails to address the foundational training required to prepare me to succeed the President.

Your initial instruction that, as a new Board member, I should just be **"listening"** has effectively transitioned into a prolonged period of silence on essential matters of officer development.

### 2. Failure to Resolve Access to Financial Reports

My attempts to gain access to necessary financial documentation to prepare for mandated budgetary duties—a critical aspect of governance—have been actively resisted by the Executive Secretary-Treasurer (EST), a resistance you have not intervened to correct.

*   I formally requested the **"full financial details per handbook guidelines"**, citing the clear mandate that organizational records **"should be open to any member at all times"**.
*   Despite this clarity, the EST dismissed my financial duties by stating the VP's role on the Budget Committee **"has no function beyond"** August.
*   While the EST stated that the books **"are available"** and the accountant's report was mailed to the finance committee, this contradicts the repeated difficulty in obtaining the necessary financial details cited above.

Your silence on my requests to encourage the Secretary to reply regarding financial statements undermines my ability to participate in fiduciary oversight.

### 3. Acceptance of Scorn and Administrative Obstruction

The final area of concern is how you expect an officer to manage the ongoing administrative hostility and scorn from the EST, which your silence implicitly validates.

*   I previously informed you that I had asked the Secretary for the handbook and **"was ignored"**.
*   When attempting to communicate with the Board, I noted that **"I don't know why you copied Jeanne on your response to me"** when I had specifically written to you seeking counsel, indicating that rather than addressing the conflict, you incorporated the administrative officer who views my involvement as problematic.
*   The EST has actively obstructed my mandated duties, previously criticizing my work on the MTNA Foundation as "**Boring and irrelevant**" [Source History] and dismissing my facility research efforts as "**useless**" [Source History].

I have noted that **"I have been silent on things for a while"** in attempting to navigate this professional hostility. However, when the President remains silent in the face of documented obstruction and discouragement directed at an elected officer, it creates an environment where governance breakdown is normalized.

Respectfully, I require your formal guidance on how, as Vice President, I am expected to proceed when basic procedural questions regarding access to information and proper communication are met with administrative scorn, silence, and active exclusion from my mandated roles.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
