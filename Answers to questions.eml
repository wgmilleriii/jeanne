Chip, below in red I=E2=80=99ve tried to address your concerns. If =
I=E2=80=99ve missed anything, please let me know. =20

And, here are a few thoughts to be considered =E2=80=A6 or not:

	According to the official job descriptions found in the PMTNM =
Bylaws and Handbook we each have our own tasks to perform. When we =
adhere to these things run smoothly. When there is too much overlapping =
or unintentional  assumption of tasks it can become annoying and lead to =
much confusion and/or false information. End result: annoyed folks =
become reluctant to assume chairmanships or other positions in the =
organization, a result PMTNM cannot afford. Irrelevant emails or calls =
simply never help.

     Similarly, the national MTNA office staff has plenty to do without =
misinformed contact or non-relevant local concerns expressed by =
individuals; MTNA deals with concerns at a national level. It's a small =
staff handling national governance via administrative staff and national =
Board; the Summit for state presidents; national financial and =
membership records; all publications; and every detail of the national =
conference: planning, preparation, registrations, competitions, etc.=20

     Since  you are new to PMTNM perhaps you are not aware of the above =
facts. We all appreciate your enthusiasm and desire to help improve the =
organization. Serving in any office is usually a =E2=80=9Clearn as you =
go=E2=80=9D process; certainly holding my office has been so over the =
years and continues to be=E2=80=A6 =F0=9F=99=82

All best,
Jeanne
