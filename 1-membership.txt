  Quote: "Here is data from the old site. I also shared a google sheet with you ... Would it be useful for us to be able to share documents like this in Google Drive? I think the need to reach out to national to get the updated list though. This is a start but it has not been updated for a long time as I understand. Jeanne can you do that?"

  Quote: "Thank you, Jeanne. Where is it? The current membership list is kept by the Sec.-Treas. and shared with anyone who needs it for a legitimate reason; it is for internal use. Or are you simply verifying that the attachment is accurate as of today? Your attachment is terribly out of date. Our membership list is current and in sync with MTNA's as of December 31, 2024. Do you have an email from MTNA with the current membership or are you confirming that the MTNA does not distribute this information to state leadership? Monthly updates are sent only to me and the President."
