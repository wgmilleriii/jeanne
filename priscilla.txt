Hi Chip, 

No, I have never gotten anything from Karla. I haven't gotten much from anyone. Not even from PMTA.  I do receive the magazine, but that's about it. 

I believe my membership comes due soon. I joined through the national website, and when I checked, that was still good, but they had me listed as an accordion teacher!

I don't have a certification. I'm not sure why I need to do that. I have a DMA and many, many years of experience. 

I am not listed on "Find a Teacher."

I'll write to Karla and ask why I haven't received anything from her but a test letter to see if she had my email address. She did. 

About heading up the violin department, what would be required of me. Wouldn't it be "Strings" and not just "violin?"

Priscilla

Hi Priscilla, did you get this? If not - have you checked in with Jeanne yet about your membership?
