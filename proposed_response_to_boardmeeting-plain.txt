Chip Miller's response should refocus discussion from conference venue logistics to governance and financial compliance requirements that must be addressed before further conference planning proceeds.

Dear President Kunitz, Ms. Grealish, Mr. Blind, and Dr. Spitzer,

Thank you, President Kunitz, for the update on the venue search and for confirming that Mr. Blind is working on arrangements for a Friday afternoon Board meeting facility. I appreciate the effort being made to locate a suitable space and the challenges noted regarding local participation.

However, given our proximity to the November conference dates, I respectfully request that we prioritize addressing governance and financial process requirements that, to my understanding, are prerequisites to responsibly proceeding with additional commitments related to the conference.

1) Budget planning and approval process
- Bylaws and handbook materials indicate that the Budget Committee (including the President, Executive Secretary-Treasurer, Immediate Past President, and Vice President) prepares a budget for the coming year and presents it to the Board for approval at the Conference Board Meeting.
- To my knowledge, the Budget Committee has not convened during my tenure as Vice President. I request we schedule this committee meeting as soon as possible to prepare the proposed budget for timely review.
- Proceeding with new financial commitments without a proposed budget prepared through the required process may present governance and fiduciary concerns for officers and the organization. Timely compliance protects everyone involved and enables the conference to move forward with clarity.

2) Vice President's role in conference planning
- My understanding from the handbook is that the President works with the Vice President and the Conference Chair in the formal planning of the annual conference.
- I would appreciate being included in conference planning discussions, calendars, and decision-making consistent with that role. This will help ensure that responsibilities are coordinated and that planning adheres to the organization's procedures.

3) Immediate requests to support compliance and planning
Given the November 7â€“8 conference timeline, I respectfully request the following:
- Access to current financial records necessary for the Budget Committee's work and for the Vice President's fiduciary responsibilities.
- Scheduling of the Budget Committee meeting at the earliest possible time to prepare the proposed budget and to present it for consideration at the Conference Board Meeting.
- Placement of governance and budget process items on the agenda for the November Board of Directors meeting pursuant to the applicable bylaws.

I look forward to collaborating to fulfill these requirements promptly so that we can proceed with conference logistics and programming on a sound, compliant basis.

Respectfully,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
