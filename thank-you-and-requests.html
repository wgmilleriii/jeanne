  <div class="body">Chip,

Since this is your first time at a Board meeting, just listening and processing is a good idea!

RE Jeanne's contributions... she has been a Teacher of the Year and also an MTNA Fellow! <mark>She also receives financial compensation for her position.</mark> Amazing how many legal forms and papers one completes for state and federal non-profits. We would also have to look at Constitution and Bylaws.

Yes, ZOOM for the meeting is usually set up and I had completely forgotten about that. if you can arrange that, we will be happy!

Happy Easter!

Sharon</div>

  <div class="body">Hi Sharon, I am writing to thank you for leading our board meeting, and also to ask for any guidance that you could give me for expectations or what you'd like my responsibilities to be. Thinking about our remote colleagues, if I could be useful in setting up remote numbers for zoom or phone calls, or taking anything else off your plate please let me know.

I know that we all have the opportunity to present to you a question, and I want to set a good example. My request is that you would consider sharing with us one of your favorite memories from PMTNM. I recognize that you have not only been the President multiple times but are one of the longest-standing members of the community, and I think everyone would appreciate hearing your personal recollections. I know that your focus for us now is membership; I know that stories are powerful tools, and your stories could be re-told by our members as they promote PMTNM.

My next request is that you would consider recognizing Jeanne as also a significant contributor to the community, and, I think, is she not one of the longest standing member in a single position? (Maybe I am wrong. Most people have held rotating positions like you, but has she not steadfastly held the Secretary position while so many positions have rotated?) I have seen her patiently deal with me this year. But I am only one of hundreds of people that she has had to deal with for PMTNM. In preparation for my request to you, I researched how non-profit organizations could recognize someone similar who has held a position in an unusual duration, and a title "Principal Secretary" was suggested as an option for a distinguishment of a single tract. Another option, an additional title could be granted outside of the secretary confinement could be "Dean of Service" or "Honorary Dean of Service". I don't have a perfect suggestion for a recognition, but I do think that some title recognition is appropriate and that many of the board members would agree.

Thank you,
Chip</div>
