  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(1:54 – 2:03)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Well, we're... It's a coming-as-an-item. All right. Here we go. A conference. Any other reports? We have a treasurer's report....</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>On fundraising</h2>

[Sam] (1:30:24 - 1:30:40)
If we're raising money to bring in specific people and we haven't decided who the specific people are yet, we can't ask. So if we had a general fund, you know, the operating account, if we're raising money for the treasury basically.

[Jeanne] (1:30:41 - 1:30:45)
Nobody is going to give you money for operations.

[Sam] (1:30:45 - 1:31:17)
Well, we can say this goes to planning the conference. This is for the conference, and we'll say what's going to be at the conference, but we need the money before we can get the people, so we shouldn't promise the people while we're asking for money. And we could also create an endowment.

What is this endowment? Is it Jane Snow or Janet Weed? Which one is the endowment?

Jane Snow. Is that a national endowment?

[Jeanne] (1:31:17 - 1:31:18)
No, it's local.

[Sam] (1:31:20 - 1:31:22)
So maybe we could raise money for that.

[Jeanne] (1:31:23 - 1:32:31)
I don't think you want to raise money for that because that money is designated to go directly to MT&A. It can't go anyplace else. We can't use any of that locally.

But I think it's too late to try to raise much money for 2025 because this is April and that's November. And summer vacation comes in between. But for the centennial, we need a handsome brochure that explains we've been around 75 years and this is what we've accomplished in that time and what we want to do.

And a little outline of our conference, what we'd like to do as our celebration. Not so much a conference as a celebration. It has to have a lot of bells and whistles to it.

[Sam] (1:32:32 - 1:32:38)
What would be involved in the celebration aspect of it that we wouldn't have at a normal conference?

[Jeanne] (1:32:38 - 1:34:01)
Well, that's what we have to plan. That's what Sharon was hoping the board would help her plan today. But for that, you can't just...

I shouldn't say can't. We can all ask our dentist to make a contribution. And I don't mind asking my dentist.

Wouldn't you like to make a contribution to this little organization for its 2025 conference? Because like every place else, we've felt the pinch. And chances are he'll say, okay, $75.

We can try the various banks where we have accounts. They may or may not. I would rather just focus on contributions for 2026.

If we want to make a big splash, bring in somebody, some high-profile pianist from California. Let me see, Indiana. There used to be a faculty member at Indiana.

He used to be here at UNM. I can't even think of her name now. Just think regional right now.

[Sam] (1:34:02 - 1:34:28)
So if we were to take the initiative and do a little fundraising on our own, we would ask whoever we're talking to to designate their contributions for either the general treasury or the 26th conference or possibly to go into a new endowment, if we can create a new endowment.

[Jeanne] (1:34:28 - 1:34:31)
Why would you want to create a new endowment?

[Sam] (1:34:32 - 1:34:42)
Well, we don't really have an old endowment. Why do you want to create an endowment? Because that ensures the long-term health of the organization.

[Jeanne] (1:34:42 - 1:34:55)
Are you going to make a yearly contribution then to the endowment? Usually it's somebody who has a big amount of funds that are willing to...

[Sam] (1:34:55 - 1:35:04)
But an endowment doesn't have to be contributed to every year. Everything grows on its own once it's started. That's why you have it.

[Jeanne] (1:35:05 - 1:35:11)
You can contribute money to our big event next year, Diamond Jewelry.

[Sam] (1:35:12 - 1:35:30)
That would be an option. So it's a question of we could give them these options. What do you want to contribute to?

But if they contribute to the endowment, then every year the endowment would make a contribution out of its interest to the treasury. So that would be an automatic contribution.

[Jeanne] (1:35:30 - 1:35:32)
How big of an endowment do you envision?

[Sam] (1:35:35 - 1:35:36)
The bigger the better.

[Chip] (1:35:38 - 1:35:41)
And if it exists, can't people contribute to it constantly?

[Sam] (1:35:41 - 1:35:42)
Anytime they want to, yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:35:42 - 1:36:21)
Well, that's what we already have, some funds. So just contribute to them. The banks will probably charge you a fee if it's too small.

You have to have a certain amount. And if you're a business, I don't know about non-profits, but a business will charge you extra fees as opposed to a personal account. We've got to move along here, though, because we need to...
