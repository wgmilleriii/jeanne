<h2>On membership and foundation reports</h2>
<div class="block section">
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(1:01 – 1:21)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Chip, let's see. Let's see. Here's... Yeah, and we need your... Supposed to have a foundation report. I've emailed you that you're in charge of the foundation and membership. Do you have a membership report?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Chip <span class="time">(1:22 – 1:26)</span></div>
    <div class="say">I would love to get a membership list, and then I could contact those people. Can I get a membership list?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:26 – 1:28)</span></div>
    <div class="say">You should have a membership list.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Chip <span class="time">(1:28 – 1:28)</span></div>
    <div class="say">How would I?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:28 – 1:29)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Yeah.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Chip <span class="time">(1:32 – 1:38)</span></div>
    <div class="say">I thought that you would have sent me a membership list, or should I just email that to reply to everybody?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:38 – 1:40)</span></div>
    <div class="say">The membership list is supposed to be online.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Chip <span class="time">(1:41 – 1:49)</span></div>
    <div class="say">I think you've missed a lot of emails, but maybe you could send me a membership list, or after this we could get a membership list.</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="line" id="no-membership-list-confirmation">
    <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(1:49 – 1:52)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Well, we all have membership lists. I do. Janna, do you?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line" </div>
    <div class="who">Janna <span class="time">(1:53)</span></div>
    <div class="say"><mark>No.</mark></div>
  </div>

  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(1:54 – 2:03)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Well, we're... It's a coming-as-an-item. All right. Here we go. A conference. Any other reports? We have a treasurer's report....</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>On fundraising</h2>
<div class="block section">
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(12:11 – 12:13)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Let's move on.... Okay, that is one more report. As I mentioned about Heather and Asya not being here, we need to really have these reports. I just want to go through and tell you, we don't have people in charge, and so I have been just going along and just saying, this is what we have from last year. <mark>And I haven't been doing advertising.</mark> I haven't had time, but I always will...</div>
  </div>

  <div class="line">
    
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:30:24 – 1:30:40)</span></div>
    <div class="say">
       <hr> <mark><i>Unanswered funraising questions</i></mark>
       <hr>
        If we're raising money to bring in specific people and we haven't decided who the specific people are yet, we can't ask. So if we had a general fund — the operating account — we're raising money for the treasury basically.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:30:41 – 1:30:45)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Nobody is going to give you money for operations.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:30:45 – 1:31:17)</span></div>
    <div class="say">We can say this goes to planning the conference — what will be at the conference — but we need the money before we can get the people, so we shouldn't promise the people while we're asking. We could also create an endowment. Which endowment is this — Jane Snow? Is that national?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:31:17 – 1:31:18)</span></div>
    <div class="say">No, it's local.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:31:20 – 1:31:22)</span></div>
    <div class="say">So maybe we could raise money for that.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:31:23 – 1:32:31)</span></div>
    <div class="say">I don't think you want to raise money for that because that money is designated to go directly to MTNA and can’t be used locally. It's also late to raise much for 2025 given the timeline. For the centennial, we need a handsome brochure explaining our history and goals, and an outline of the celebration — lots of bells and whistles.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:32:32 – 1:32:38)</span></div>
    <div class="say">What would be involved in the celebration that we wouldn’t have at a normal conference?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:32:38 – 1:34:01)</span></div>
    <div class="say">That’s what we have to plan. Sharon hoped the board would help plan today. We can ask local businesses and banks for contributions; I'd rather focus on 2026. If we want a big splash, bring a high-profile artist — but think regionally for now.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:34:02 – 1:34:28)</span></div>
    <div class="say">If we fundraise, we can let donors designate to the general treasury, the 2026 conference, or a new endowment.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:34:28 – 1:34:31)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Why create a new endowment?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:34:32 – 1:34:42)</span></div>
    <div class="say">It ensures long‑term health of the organization.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:34:42 – 1:34:55)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Usually it starts with a significant contribution. Would there be a yearly contribution?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:34:55 – 1:35:04)</span></div>
    <div class="say">An endowment doesn’t need contributions every year; it grows and yields interest for the treasury.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:35:05 – 1:35:11)</span></div>
    <div class="say">You can contribute to our big event next year — Diamond Jewelry.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:35:12 – 1:35:30)</span></div>
    <div class="say">We can offer options: endowment, treasury, or 2026 conference. The endowment would contribute annually from interest.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:35:30 – 1:35:32)</span></div>
    <div class="say">How big of an endowment?
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:35:35 – 1:35:36)</span></div>
    <div class="say">The bigger the better.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Chip <span class="time">(1:35:38 – 1:35:41)</span></div>
    <div class="say">And if it exists, can’t people contribute constantly?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sam <span class="time">(1:35:41 – 1:35:42)</span></div>
    <div class="say">Anytime, yes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(1:35:42 – 1:36:21)</span></div>
    <div class="say">We already have some funds — contribute to those. Note bank fees and minimums; business accounts can have extra fees. We need to move along…</div>

  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:36:26 – 1:38:20)</span></div>
    <div class="say">But I saw... Did Larry Blind, was he a Teacher of the Year in the past years? ... They're all listed in the back of the directory... This is an old directory. ICF-21, 22. Yeah.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">

  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Jeanne <span class="time">(1:39:17 – 1:39:30)</span></div>
    <div class="say"><mark>I believe the reason Teri Resch was not nominated last time was she has not contributed very much to community service.</mark></div>
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <div class="who">Chip <span class="time">(1:39:36 – 1:40:01)</span></div>

  <h2>On the directory (printed and online)</h2>
  
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Sharon <span class="time">(1:46:02)</span></div>
      <div class="say">Okay, also for the directory, we've had information, people asking for a new directory. And I think we have the funds, don't we, where we could afford to have a directory, Gene? </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Jeanne</div>
      <div class="say">The directory's not so expensive to print. It is expensive to mail. So, I mean, it would be a matter of taking a sample to the post office and ask them now what the postage would be. But it was something like 90 cents the last time we mailed them out. And postage has gone up.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Sharon</div>
      <div class="say">Yeah. Maybe we can keep it. I'm sorry.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Jeanne</div>
      <div class="say">No, maybe we can, you can just keep it for conference and we can pick it up. We don't have to send it. Then it would be out of date. No, in November. Is there an online directory? Well, supposedly, the equivalent of the directory is on the website. I have no luck with it, and I find MTNA people. And it's true, some people have asked for a printed directory. They like having it in hand, and I understand that. But I'm lucky, Pierre, who gets to put it together. At this point, memberships are beginning to renew for next year. So in preparing the printed directory in the past, we've waited until about December to put everything together, because then we have a pretty accurate record of who's going to join. Because if you print it too soon, you leave out people.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Sharon</div>
      <div class="say">Right, right. And then you have to send out an addendum.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Jeanne</div>
      <div class="say">So in November, we can have kind of, you will know better, and we can pick it up. Or, Ivanov's suggestion, you can, for example, to Santa Fe, you don't need to send everyone. You can just send it to me, and we'll distribute it. And just give them personally, and it's all safe for postage. Like in Los Alamos, send it to Wendy and she'll...</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Sharon</div>
      <div class="say">So you're saying, have the directory ready by the 9th of November?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      <div class="who">Jeanne</div>
      <div class="say">Well, actually, by then, most of the members would be in. Will that be the time to distribute it? It is, but it's a question of getting it. It takes time to put it together, the formatting.</div>
