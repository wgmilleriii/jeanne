The handbook has always been available to every member ‚Ä¶ years ago as a hard copy; since then, on line at the website.

Hi Jeanne, do you have a copy of the handbook? It would be great if everybody had access to it! So sad that it has been unavailable for years! Would you send me a copy? I'll add it to the website. I know that would help a lot. It would be great if all had a copy rather than email going out referencing something that only a few people have had access to. How confusing! Also, what is this misinformed contact you to referenced? Please clarify.   Thanks, Chip

Chip, below in red I‚Äôve tried to address your concerns. If I‚Äôve missed anything, please let me know.  

And, here are a few thoughts to be considered ‚Ä¶ or not:

	According to the official job descriptions found in the PMTNM Bylaws and Handbook we each have our own tasks to perform. When we adhere to these things run smoothly. When there is too much overlapping or unintentional  assumption of tasks it can become annoying and lead to much confusion and/or false information. End result: annoyed folks become reluctant to assume chairmanships or other positions in the organization, a result PMTNM cannot afford. Irrelevant emails or calls simply never help.

     Similarly, the national MTNA office staff has plenty to do without misinformed contact or non-relevant local concerns expressed by individuals; MTNA deals with concerns at a national level. It's a small staff handling national governance via administrative staff and national Board; the Summit for state presidents; national financial and membership records; all publications; and every detail of the national conference: planning, preparation, registrations, competitions, etc. 

     Since  you are new to PMTNM perhaps you are not aware of the above facts. We all appreciate your enthusiasm and desire to help improve the organization. Serving in any office is usually a ‚Äúlearn as you go‚Äù process; certainly holding my office has been so over the years and continues to be‚Ä¶ üôÇ

All best,
Jeanne

Thank you, Jeanne. Where is it? The current membership list is kept by the Sec.-Treas. and shared with anyone who needs it for a legitimate reason; it is for internal use.

Or are you simply verifying that the attachment is accurate as of today?Your attachment is terribly out of date.  Our membership list is current and in sync with MTNA's as of December 31, 2024.

Do you have an email from MTNA with the current membership or are you confirming that the MTNA does not distribute this information to state leadership?Monthly updates are sent onlyto me and the President.

 Is MTNA aware of our current leadership? YES!!

Please clarify and provide more information. Thank you, Jeanne!

Hi Sharon, 
Here is data from the old site. I also shared a good sheet with you , https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NEz0q2wEy-3DIOU0S6uvOAuP_swEZnx-JM7Eabnibts/edit?usp=sharing . Would it be useful for us to be able to share documents like this in Google Drive ? 

I think the need to reach out to national to get the updated list though. This is a start but it has not been updated for a long time as I understand. Jeanne can you do that?

Chip,

Do you have the listing for a mass mailing to the membership?  I want to send them a New Year's greeting and plans for the year.
