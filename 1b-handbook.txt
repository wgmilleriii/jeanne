  Quote: "The other item that was never added to the website is the Handbook – primarily because the existing complete Handbook is horribly out of date. ... The Student Activities section of the Handbook is online as it has undergone edits as needed through the years."

Observation
- Larry (site maintainer) asserts the complete Handbook was never added to the website (only the Student Activities section was online), directly contradicting Jeanne’s claim that the handbook was online and always available on the website. The contradiction predates Chip’s January 9, 2025 exchange.
