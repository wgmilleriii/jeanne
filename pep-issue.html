  <div class="body">Janna thank you so much for your input/help with making sure that this is all accurate for everybody and that there is no confusion. My usefulness is only technical, and I am very much reliant upon you for accurate content. I will also explore simpler ways so that you can just update the website without me, if that would be useful.</div>

  <div class="body">Hello Chip,

Thank you for your hard work on this website. I understand that it's not easy to do everything correctly.
We can always confirm information about PEP before posting it. PEP is a small but important part of PMTNM activities.
I already provided you with dates of upcoming PEP in 3 districts.
Best way to write correct info is to copy it from a Handbook. I'm sure Sharon has an updated copy but I can copy you what I have:

<code>The Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) is a PMTNM sponsored non-competitive general audition.
The repertoire, dates and general rules are determined by the PEP Committee.</code>

Also, would you be so kind as to post on the website forms that I mentioned in a previous email in a way that anyone could find them easily.
Enjoy your weekend,
Janna</div>

  <div class="body">Hi Janna,

You are actually the first person to give direction regarding any content on the website. I really wish that I had a copy of the handbook. I’ve been a member for a couple of years and I have never seen one despite my requests. I have received only conflicting information, apart from what you are sending me. I have looked on the old site and I don’t see the forms that you are mentioning, I’m sorry.

In order to streamline updates, can you please follow this procedure? Copy the text from the website into an email, and change the text however you want. I will take the entire text, copy it once and paste it into the website on top of what already exists. That will save me from going back and forth between a lot of emails and probably missing something again. Thank you.</div>
