Thank you. Let's talk first thing Thursday morning.
Please email me a list of what to expect. Please focus on emails to district president from the
vice president. I have reviewed the entire handbook and have a list of questions of questions.
What is the date on the Handbook you received?
Jeanne, please refer to my last email to you and respond with your opinion regarding
website content. My opinion has n0t changed. The old website was attractive. Please
confer with Sharon on all website content requests. Please send me information on setting
up new scholarships. This is not your territory. It is that of the Board. Please send me
the full financial details per handbook guidelines. The 2024-2025 budget was approved
last November by the Board and membership. Current financial reports are shared with
all Board members and the membership. Review will take place at the April Board
meeting. The VP is on the Budget planning committee which does its work in August
and has no function beyond that. All Board members and general membership are
treated equally. The CPA watches over PMTNM and its financial details.
Thank you,
Chip
