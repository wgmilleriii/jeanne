Hi, Sharon,
Of course I will help you! We can send it out to the list we have now and again to the delta when we get updated
membership lists. So here is the data from the old site. I emailed you also a sample template , please let me know if you
would like any assistance for the mailout.
Thank you,
Chip

Hi, Chip,
After a busy week of visiting tile stores, designing remodeling projects, I can focus on PMTNM
again.
I looked at your survey for conference and that is a great plan. Could you send it out to the
membership? I don't have a complete list of emails but need one. If you have the list, could you
forward to me, please?

Hi Sharon,
Here is data from the old site. I also shared a good sheet with you , https://docs.google.com/
spreadsheets/d/1NEz0q2wEy-3DIOU0S6uvOAuP_swEZnx-JM7Eabnibts/edit?usp=sharing . Would it be useful for us to
be able to share documents like this in Google Drive ?
I think the need to reach out to national to get the updated list though. This is a start but it has not been updated for a
long time as I understand. Jeanne can you do that?

Chip,
Do you have the listing for a mass mailing to the membership? I want to send them a New
Year's greeting and plans for the year.
Thanks,
Sharon
