Chip Miller's response must strategically shift the focus from the practical challenge of locating a venue (which Sharon and Jeanne have used to dismiss his efforts) back to the **mandatory financial and governance breaches** that legally prohibit the organization from moving forward with the November conference planning.

The response should be directed to the President, Sharon Kunitz, acknowledging her recent communications, while clearly defining the boundaries of procedural authority.

***

Dear Sharon, Jeanne, Larry, and Laura,

Thank you, Sharon, for the update on the venue search and for confirming the arrangements that **Larry Blind** is attempting to make for the Friday afternoon Board meeting facility. I also appreciate your transparency regarding the difficulty in securing local venues, noting that **"Members in ABQ won't even drive 2 miles to the event!!"**.

However, the continued discussion of conference logistics must be put on hold until the urgent matters concerning PMTNM governance and financial authority are resolved.

### 1. Lack of Mandated Financial Planning

The fundamental issue is that **there is no procedurally valid budget** for the conference expenditures, which risks financial integrity and fiduciary liability for all officers involved.

*   **Mandatory Committee Requirement:** The Bylaws mandate that the Budget Committee (which explicitly includes the President, Executive Secretary-Treasurer, Immediate Past President, and Vice President) **must** convene to "prepare a budget for the coming year and present it to the Board for approval at the Conference Board Meeting".
*   **Procedural Breach:** This committee **has not met** since I took office, and the EST stated on October 7, 2025, that there will **"probably will be no need for an actual meeting"**.
*   **Repudiation of Governance:** This exclusion from my mandated duty is justified by the EST's public statement that the Handbook, which contains the Bylaws defining our budget process, is "grossly out of date" and that **"PMTNM does not function under any legal mandates!"**.
*   **Urgency:** The conference is four weeks away, and moving forward with commitments for facilities, Honors competitions, and presenters without a budget prepared through mandated procedures sets a precedent that governing requirements can be ignored at will.

### 2. Exclusion from Conference and Leadership Duties

Regarding facility planning, the governance conflict is compounded by the systematic exclusion of the elected Vice President.

*   **Violation of Officer Duties:** The President is mandated to **"work with the Vice President and Conference Chairman in the formal planning of the annual conference"**. Instead, you created an ad hoc planning group consisting of yourself, the EST (Jeanne Grealish), the Immediate Past President (Larry Blind), and **Laura Spitzer**.
*   **EST's Dismissal of Legitimate Effort:** The EST's characterization of my efforts to locate a facility as a **"waste of everyoneâ€™s time and a senseless cluttering up of mail boxes"** is highly unprofessional and demonstrates a clear intent to obstruct the mandated involvement of the Vice President, even in solving a recognized logistical problem.

The EST proceeded to define the organization's future outside the established leadership structure by stating that "**As president Laura Spitzer will consult with her conference committee**... as to the location of the 2026 anniversary conference". This inappropriate designation of an unelected leader and the active dismissal of a current, elected officer's role reinforces the systematic governance failure.

### 3. Immediate Demands

As previously requested, and given the proximity of the November 7-8 Conference:

1.  I require **immediate access to all financial records** to fulfill my fiduciary duty to prepare for the budget review.
2.  I must insist that a meeting of the mandated **Budget Committee be scheduled immediately** to formulate and approve the fiscal year budget before the November 7-8 Conference Board Meeting.
3.  I formally request that these governance concerns be placed on the **November 7-8 Board of Directors meeting agenda**, pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the PMTNM Bylaws.

Further discussion of conference facilities and programming cannot responsibly proceed until the mandated financial oversight processes are honored and restored.

Sincerely,

Chip Miller
Vice President, PMTNM
