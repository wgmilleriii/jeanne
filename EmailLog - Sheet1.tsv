(No copies were ever printed. The file was used online by individuals to print if desired.) In 2023-24 Larry Blind did laboriously update the Handbook section regarding student competitions and activities. At this time I do not have a copy of those revisions.  As for a printed directory/roster, that isn’t likely to happen until early January. Folks continue to join up until all MTNA competition deadlines have passed; that is now early November. Any printing prior to that time would involve numerous updates via newsletter or mass emails.  You were very kind to offer to underwrite the cost of a Handbook copy and the directory mailing which is an unknown since postal rates are projected to increase.  Consequently your check will be returned since there is no cost for the Handbook and no concrete figure for a mailing. Perhaps when things are more definite you might make another contribution.  All best

Chip may or may not know that a committee met and came up with many revisions, however no notes or documents of the changes seems to exist.  Ron Grinage was the person who supposedly had this information, however when I was president and contacted him he did not have anything saved.  As always, any changes to the Handbook have to be approved by the officers, and possibly the membership if it is a change to the Bylaws.  Jeanne knows more about this than I do, but I believe she said that changes to the Bylaws also have to be filed with the state.  As for the Honors Auditions, it may be possible for the District VPs to come together and plan and run the state auditions.  However, Mike Lively and Laura Spitzer (if she is still VP for

As I have said, if no one volunteers for Honors, there will be no need for them in a fall conference,  The conference would require the mandated Board and general membership meetings which can be scheduled anytime.  I will send out another "Help" email in June.  In late July/August, a date can be determined for whatever meetings we need. The District VPs handle their own activities, and the Handbook lets them function independently.  See Article V: OFFICERS; Section     : Officers and Duties.  I recall the vice-president working with District VPs as designated... no letters or reports.  They send their reports to the Board meetings, which we had April 25. This is a busy time of the year with recitals and student evaluations for teachers.  Mid-summer can be planning time again.  No need for busy-ness and stress for us!! Sharon

Knowledge of the organization and experience with it are essential. A schedule cannot be made without both.  Detailed planning and outlined changes are not tasks for one who has never been on the PMTNM Board or held any position in the organization.   Sometimes its wise to back off and learn before trying to lead.  Best, Jeanne    > On Mar 17, 2025, at 1:00 PM, Willis Glen Miller, III <wgmilleriii@gmail.com> wrote: > I think that's Sharon.

Sharon, do we still have a PMTNM Handbook? I have an old addition and I know it was revised a few years ago. I know Chip is a new to all of these events and I want to help to clarify it. Chip, general rules and repertoire are not determine by PEP chair, it was established by handbook and we have a very clear set of rules for PEP. There were forms with scales and repertoire requirements. I have some forms if you need it. Also, local chairman decide time and date for PEP. This year PEP in Los Alamos will be on April 4-5, In Albuquerque on April 12 and in Santa Fe on April 26. Could you please correct dates on a website. I couldn't find PEP judging evaluation sheet and judge's expense request on a website. Also, please correct a phrase; entrants must be ....member of PMTNM (not a SFMTA). Thank you Chip for doing this hard work.

I understand that it's not easy to do everything correctly. We can always confirm information about PEP before posting it. PEP is a small but important part of PMTNM activities. I already provided you with dates of upcoming PEP in 3 districts. Best way to write correct info to copy it from a Handbook.  I'm sure Sharon has an updated copy but I can copy you what I have:       "The Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) is a PMTNM sponsored non-competitive general audition. The repertoire, dates and general rules are determined by the PEP Committee." Also, would you be so kind as to post on a website forms that I mentioned in a previous email in a way that anyone could find them easily. Enjoy your weekend, Janna     On Sat, Feb 22, 2025 at 7:19 AM Willis Glen Miller, III < wgmilleriii@gmail.com> wrote:  > P.s., > Janna thank you so much for your input/help with making sure that this is > all accurate for eve

I really wish that I had a copy of the handbook. I’ve been a member for a couple of years and I have never seen one despite my requests. I have received only conflicting information, apart from what you are sending me. I have looked on the old site and I don’t see the forms that you are mentioning, I’m sorry. In order to streamline updates, can you please follow this procedure? Copy the text from the website into an email, and change the text however you want. I will take the entire text copy it once and paste it into the website on top of what already exists that will save me from going back-and-forth in between a lot of emails And probably missing something again.

I'll review all the emails and do another pass on the member page and consolidate everything so far. I saw Ferrel over the weekend and he gave me a copy of the handbook, it might be an older version but at least it is a starting point. I took it to the music school and they scanned it in liketysplit, to 2 big pdfs, but I should be able to extract text. Next week I am in Virginia seeing my mom and my schedule will be unpredictable. I'll check in again tonight with an update on pdf to text conversion, I think I can import the handbook to text. At least I will be able to get to a "reset text" system with you. Thank you. Sometimes all I have the ability to do for days is respond to texts or look at a tiny screen. Today I have a big screen. More soon..  On Wed, Feb 26, 2025 at 12:12 PM Janna Warren <jannavwarren@gmail.com> wrote:  > Hello Chip, I think it’s a good idea to meet online and adjust a PEP > section.

You put it in a Members column and there everything is correct. But on a Home page under Upcoming events dates are wrong and it was where teachers search for forms and information. Los Alamos PEP is on April 4-5 not 26. Albuquerque PEP is on April 12 and Allyssa Pehrson is a chairperson. Actually she couldn't find any forms but I sent her some.                                                                       Los Alamos Spring meeting is on April 27th, not may 17. I will let you know date for Clovis PEP later. It would be nice if you could update dates on a main page. Thank youi very much for your hard work. Janna  On Wed, Mar 12, 2025 at 6:58 PM Willis Glen Miller, III < wgmilleriii@gmail.com> wrote:  > absolutely.

Calendar Updates:    - Los Alamos PEP: April 4-5    - Albuquerque PEP: April 12    - Los Alamos Spring Meeting: April 27    All dates are now consistent between the home page and members section.  2. Forms and Information:    - Added clear links to PEP forms on the home page    - Made sure all district information is easy to find    - Updated the FAQ to help teachers locate resources  3. Member Privacy:    - Cleaned up how we display contact information    - Members can still find everything they need after logging in    - Public pages now use our general contact channels  Everything should be working smoothly now, but let me know if you'd like me to explain any of the changes in more detail.  Best regards, Chip  On Thu, Mar 13, 2025 at 1:06 PM Janna Warren <jannavwarren@gmail.com> wrote:  > Hello Chip, > I finally understood why teachers can't find information about PEP.

That's really helpful feedback. I was focused on making sure the site looked professional and showcased membership benefits, but we definitely need to make sure it's appealing to potential students too. I based the design on an analysis of 50 other state music teacher association websites, which helps us look more professional and attract new members. It should be more engaging for our current members, too. I spent a lot of time working on a newsletter proof of concept (with pretty formatting) and the surveys. We can start using those as soon as you wish.  I'm already working on getting the mountain image Jeanne liked back in, because I know it's important to you and the website, and I think it adds a great element.  Also, it would be helpful if you could clarify a couple of things for me:  ● You mentioned a "lost email".

If I’ve missed anything, please let me know.    And, here are a few thoughts to be considered … or not:   According to the official job descriptions found in the PMTNM Bylaws and Handbook we each have our own tasks to perform. When we adhere to these things run smoothly. When there is too much overlapping or unintentional  assumption of tasks it can become annoying and lead to much confusion and/or false information. End result: annoyed folks become reluctant to assume chairmanships or other positions in the organization, a result PMTNM cannot afford. Irrelevant emails or calls simply never help.       Similarly, the national MTNA office staff has plenty to do without misinformed contact or non-relevant local concerns expressed by individuals; MTNA deals with concerns at a national level.

Do you want me to help you blast it out? It is a trivial procedure. The survey questions that I put in the template were to be simply reviewed and tweaked before sending out; it was a proof of concept that everything would work technically. I made a section at the home page of https://artsmetrics.net/pmtnm/newsitepreview/ for you to put in a welcome letter for new members too. The other content that is on the site is just placeholders to show what it will look like when we get dates in the future. If we are to reach new members, the focus of the website needs to be just that. You will need to nudge Larry to get the contact information of our website host. I am a little disappointed that he never responded to my questions when Jeanne directed me to him. When would you like to Starbucks again?   On Mon, Dec 9, 2024 at 9:50 AM slkunitz@aol.com <slkunitz@aol.com> wrote:  > Chip, > > This is a new a

Knowledge of the organization and experience with it are essential. A schedule cannot be made without both.  Detailed planning and outlined changes are not tasks for one who has never been on the PMTNM Board or held any position in the organization.   Sometimes its wise to back off and learn before trying to lead.  Best, Jeanne    > On Mar 17, 2025, at 1:00 PM, Willis Glen Miller, III <wgmilleriii@gmail.com> wrote: > I think that's Sharon.

I was president in 1980, 2014-2016 (3 years) and now 2025 - 1 year.  Last year, no one would accept the position and I volunteered to do the job for 1 year.  Laura is well-prepared for the position, having served as District VP, attending conferences and is retiring from faculty position.  It is important to have a leader who knows the membership and the state, and she volunteered!!  In fact, she should be attending Presidents meetings in Cincinnati this week.  I have been there too many times and it is time for new and enthusiastic leaders.  In fact, I was MTNA Vice-President 1996-1998. All of the computer benefits sound good but they mean nothing to me.  Opening various portals, etc. are for the computer enthusiasts!!  Perhaps you can display all of these for Jeanne and me sometime this fall. Back to the students!! Sharon      On Thursday, September 4, 2025 at 11:05:16 AM MDT, Willis Glen Miller, III <wgmilleri

Chip may or may not know that a committee met and came up with many revisions, however no notes or documents of the changes seems to exist.  Ron Grinage was the person who supposedly had this information, however when I was president and contacted him he did not have anything saved.  As always, any changes to the Handbook have to be approved by the officers, and possibly the membership if it is a change to the Bylaws.  Jeanne knows more about this than I do, but I believe she said that changes to the Bylaws also have to be filed with the state.  As for the Honors Auditions, it may be possible for the District VPs to come together and plan and run the state auditions.

I am thinking of my first "general" letter that needs to go out, and because I am new I haven't actually seen any previous letters. In any case, I will plan on drafting things and running them by you before any distribution. Back to planning.. another take-away from the meeting was that the vps would plan the conference - I am optimistic because I will be playing the role of a "member" (expecting to hear from my district vp through an email) - as well as a coordinator to you. Shall I draft a "call to action" / summary letter to the vps that we all need to put our heads together, and organize a conferen

Not many organizations can claim such longevity! To celebrate, MTNA is offering grants of up to $1,000 to member organizations who wish to join in the celebration. We have applied for a grant to honor both anniversaries.   🎉The additional funding would help us plan special programming for that major event  ➨ Meanwhile, our 2025 conference will be coming up November 7-9 with Friday afternoon sessions, Board meeting, and meal on your own followed by an hour concert by new members. As usual, Saturday is reserved for student competitions.   TIME TO PARTICIPATE There is need to fill several State Chairs. 🎶Most important is the Honors Chair. Without an Honors Chair, there can be no Honors competitions.  There is also need for a communications person, to send out Segue articles by and to the membership.  It would be great if members could share what they and their students are

I think I am in two or three - piano, composition... I just realized there are no teachers listed for Group Piano either, and this could be an avenue for calls. I know it's not your first choice, but it may lead to prospects. I assume you teach group violin? But there is no group violin section. I don't know if MTNA will add a new section like Accodortion, but - if they do, do you want both ?? Your domain is now "strings" (imagine like piano.pmtnm.org , but what about group-lessons.pmtnm.org ? ) For these domains I am asking for your input on - I need your fresh ideas and perspective. Don't worry about writing style or typos, everything gets fed through an AI neutralizer. Your fresh perspective is valuable! Think big picture, as simple as "what article needs to be written"? Then AI will help write things and we can refine them in an iterative process. Does that make sense?  On Mon, Mar 24, 2025 at 8:51 PM p

I haven't gotten much from anyone. Not even from PMTA.  I do receive the magazine, but that's about it.  I believe my membership comes due soon. I joined through the national website, and when I checked, that was still good, but they had me listed as an accordion teacher!  I don't have a certification. I'm not sure why I need to do that. I have a DMA and many, many years of experience.  I am not listed on "Find a Teacher."  I'll write to Karla and ask why I haven't received anything from her but a test letter to see if she had my email address. She did.  About heading up the violin department, what would be required of me. Wouldn't it be "Strings" and not just "violin?"  Priscilla   ________________________________ From: Willis Glen Miller, III <wgmilleriii@gmail.com> Sent: Thursday, March 20, 2025 8:29 PM To: priscilla hallbergarts.com <priscilla@hallbergarts.com> Subject: Fwd: New Member PMTNM  Hi Priscilla

Can you clarify? Your question please? Also thank you again for your input for putting back the mountain. I look at it every day. Do you like the early morning sun or the evening sun? I am attaching three pictures (not to be distributed for professional evaluation) just your input on color scheme because the color is great right now. I was thinking too about music? IE do you want to have music playing in the background (with proper controls) like “hall of the mountain king” or “climb every mountain” or something maybe a little more sophisticated? Some people may not like music though.

That's really helpful feedback. I was focused on making sure the site looked professional and showcased membership benefits, but we definitely need to make sure it's appealing to potential students too. I based the design on an analysis of 50 other state music teacher association websites, which helps us look more professional and attract new members. It should be more engaging for our current members, too. I spent a lot of time working on a newsletter proof of concept (with pretty formatting) and the surveys. We can start using those as soon as you wish.  I'm already working on getting the mountain image Jeanne liked back in, because I know it's important to you and the website, and I think it adds a great element.  Also, it would be helpful if you could clarify a couple of things for me:  ● You mentioned a "lost email". Could you give me a little m

When we adhere to these things run smoothly. When there is too much overlapping or unintentional  assumption of tasks it can become annoying and lead to much confusion and/or false information. End result: annoyed folks become reluctant to assume chairmanships or other positions in the organization, a result PMTNM cannot afford. Irrelevant emails or calls simply never help.       Similarly, the national MTNA office staff has plenty to do without misinformed contact or non-relevant local concerns expressed by individuals; MTNA deals with concerns at a national level.

Do you want me to help you blast it out? It is a trivial procedure. The survey questions that I put in the template were to be simply reviewed and tweaked before sending out; it was a proof of concept that everything would work technically. I made a section at the home page of https://artsmetrics.net/pmtnm/newsitepreview/ for you to put in a welcome letter for new members too. The other content that is on the site is just placeholders to show what it will look like when we get dates in the future. If we are to reach new members, the focus of the website needs to be just that. You will need to nudge Larry to get the contact information of our website host.

Do you want me to help you blast it out? It is a trivial procedure. The survey questions that I put in the template were to be simply reviewed and tweaked before sending out; it was a proof of concept that everything would work technically. I made a section at the home page of https://artsmetrics.net/pmtnm/newsitepreview/ for you to put in a welcome letter for new members too. The other content that is on the site is just placeholders to show what it will look like when we get dates in the future. If we are to reach new members, the focus of the website needs to be just that. You will need to nudge Larry to get the contact information of our website host. I am a little disappointed that he never responded to my questions when Jeanne directed me to him. When would you like to Starbucks again?   On Mon, Dec 9, 2024 at 9:50 AM slkunitz@aol.com <slkunitz@aol.com> wrote:  > Chip, > > This is a new a

No need to respond.  I will be CCing you on PMTNM communications from here on out. The subject will be clear, so if you want to put a filter on PMTNM and mark as processed or archived, that is fine, temporarily - I need to be timely in my emails to Sharon and Jeanne so if there is a different person like the secretary that you want these to be CCed to that's great - please let me know. Jeanne has crossed the line now and there are reams of emails that I will be sending in with the welfare of New Mexico in mind. Jeanne is kind of at the center of it, and - she has contributed much. She is valued. She is an NCTM. I do not want to lash out at her. Her students have done well. But, she has been an obstacle and contrary to the handbook of PMTNM. and I am at my wits end.  Please see below for her response to our announcement for the MTNA foundation. This is my opener to you for a conversation in the future.  I will be reaching ou
