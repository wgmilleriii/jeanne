Chip,
I knew that we had work to do, but my husband had major surgery Feb 18 and is slowly recovering
at home this week. Just returned from another medical appointment. Will put this project on
calendar for weekend.

Dear Sharon,
I received a handbook from Ferrell. After reading it I realize there is much to do.
After scanning it in, I took the contents to the internet and asked for a calendar to be extracted from its contents.

Please, help. I have much to do. I will begin reading now.
Thank you,
Chip
