Hi Janna,
You are actually the first person to give direction regarding any content on the website. I really wish that I had a copy of the handbook. I’ve been a member for a couple of years and I have never seen one despite my requests. I have received only conflicting information, apart from what you are sending me. I have looked on the old site and I don’t see the forms that you are mentioning, I’m sorry.
In order to streamline updates, can you please follow this procedure? Copy the text from the website into an email, and change the text however you want. I will take the entire text copy it once and paste it into the website on top of what already exists that will save me from going back-and-forth in between a lot of emails And probably missing something again.  Thank you.

Hello Chip, 
thank you for your hard work on this website. I understand that it's not easy to do everything correctly. 
We can always confirm information about PEP before posting it. PEP is a small but important part of PMTNM activities.  
I already provided you with dates of upcoming PEP in 3 districts. 
Best way to write correct info to copy it from a Handbook.  I'm sure Sharon has an updated copy but I can copy you what I have: 
      "The Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) is a PMTNM sponsored non-competitive general audition.
The repertoire, dates and general rules are determined by the PEP Committee."
Also, would you be so kind as to post on a website forms that I mentioned in a previous email in a way that anyone could find them easily.
Enjoy your weekend,
Janna

I will certainly respect your time before we get on a meeting. I'll review all the emails and do another pass on the member page and consolidate everything so far. I saw Ferrel over the weekend and he gave me a copy of the handbook, it might be an older version but at least it is a starting point. I took it to the music school and they scanned it in liketysplit, to 2 big pdfs, but I should be able to extract text. Next week I am in Virginia seeing my mom and my schedule will be unpredictable. 
I'll check in again tonight with an update on pdf to text conversion, I think I can import the handbook to text. At least I will be able to get to a "reset text" system with you.
Thank you. Sometimes all I have the ability to do for days is respond to texts or look at a tiny screen. Today I have a big screen. More soon..

Hello Chip, I think it’s a good idea to meet online and adjust a PEP section. I can do it Monday or Wednesday morning. Do you use What’s Up or Zoom? Janna

Hello Chip,
You better contact to Sharon and ask for a Handbook. She must have an updated copy of it. Sorry to say but there were forms on a previous website- teachers used them last year. I can forward them to you from my computer to post. I’m curious why did you even start a new website when we had a good one that was only 2 years old?                                             I don’t have much time now to do what you suggested. Maybe can do it later in spring. I don’t want to take so much of your time also. Talk to Sharon- she is a President.                 Best wishes. Janna

P.s., 
Janna thank you so much for your input/help with making sure that this is all accurate for everybody and that there is no confusion. My Usefulness is only technical, and I am very much reliant upon you guys for accurate content. I will also explore simpler ways so that you can just update the website without me, If that would be useful.

Whatever content needs to change on the site, please let me know. It’s fine if you just copy and paste text and change it, however you want. Send an email to me and I will update the site.

Hello Chip and Sharon,
hopefully you are well.
I think we need to clarify PEP page on a new website because some of the information is not correct. Sharon, do we still have a PMTNM Handbook? I have an old addition and I know it was revised a few years ago. I know Chip is a new to all of these events and I want to help to clarify it.
Chip, general rules and repertoire are not determine by PEP chair, it was established by handbook and we have a very clear set of rules for PEP. There were forms with scales and repertoire requirements. I have some forms if you need it. Also, local chairman decide time and date for PEP. This year PEP in Los Alamos will be on April 4-5, In Albuquerque on April 12 and in Santa Fe on April 26. Could you please correct dates on a website.
I couldn't find PEP judging evaluation sheet and judge's expense request on a website. 
Also, please correct a phrase; entrants must be ....member of PMTNM (not a SFMTA).
Thank you Chip for doing this hard work. I know it's a lot and trying to help.
Have a nice weekend.
Janna,
State PEP chair
