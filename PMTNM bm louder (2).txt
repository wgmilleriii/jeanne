[Sharon] (1:01 - 1:21)
Chip, let's see. Let's see. Here's...

Yeah, and we need your... Supposed to have a foundation report. I've emailed you that you're in charge of the foundation and membership.

Do you have a membership report?

[Chip] (1:22 - 1:26)
I would love to get a membership list, and then I could contact those people. Can I get a membership list?

[Jeanne] (1:26 - 1:28)
You should have a membership list.

[Chip] (1:28 - 1:28)
How would I?

[Jeanne] (1:28 - 1:29)
Yeah.

[Chip] (1:32 - 1:38)
I thought that you would have sent me a membership list, or should I just email that to reply to everybody?

[Jeanne] (1:38 - 1:40)
The membership list is supposed to be online.

[Chip] (1:41 - 1:49)
I think you've missed a lot of emails, but maybe you could send me a membership list, or after this we could get a membership list.

[Sharon] (1:49 - 1:52)
Well, we all have membership lists. I do.

[Jeanne] (1:52 - 1:53)
Do you, Janna?



[Janna] (1:53 - 1:53)
No.

[Sharon] (1:53 - 1:54)
No, okay.

[Jeanne] (1:54 - 2:03)
Well, we're...

It's a coming-as-an-item. All right. Here we go.

A conference. Any other reports? We have a treasurer's report....



[Speaker 7] (2:03 - 2:04)
Do you want that?

[Jeanne] (2:04 - 2:06)
I didn't have it on here.

[Sharon] (2:06 - 2:07)
All right.

[Jeanne] (2:07 - 2:18)
Yes, I was wondering about the money. Let's get the money out of the way here for everybody. Yeah.

Yes, I was. You have a copy of the secretary treasurer's report, I hope. Mm-hmm.



[Lori] (2:18 - 2:18)
Do you?

[Jeanne] (2:19 - 5:43)
There's nothing new. I mean, the first paragraph is always going to be there because it's boilerplate.

All expenses to date have been paid, all documents are filed, and all transfers to the operating fund from the general... All transfers from the operating fund to the various little funds have been made. At conference time, people write one check and they have their donation included in that, so it all goes into the operating fund, and it's tracked separately, but then it has to be pulled out.

So if they're healthy donations, the operating fund will suddenly hit a little bump in the road because when these are distributed, operating funds will go down. So the various funds, as of today, are listed there, and the only two that we can touch are the operating fund and the... something else there.

We can't touch the walker, and there isn't really anything else new because we haven't had much activity. And if any time anybody wants to see the books, they're there, they're available. The accountant's annual report was mailed to the finance committee, and the question about the bank signatures, Sharon and I need to go to the bank and see if Bank America will just have the president's signature as the alternate, because when we tried to have, I don't remember who it was who wanted it, they wanted the president and the vice president, and Bank America had a fit and sent all of these forms that had to be filled out. And Larry and Sheryl Keshet Brooks, I don't know if Sheryl ever got the forms filled out, but the last person signing the forms had to send all of this back to Bank of America in San Francisco, and it would have put those two signatures on the card.

Well, our officers would change. So what was then on the card would not be valid. So at the last meeting, it was determined that that motion that had been made earlier would be rescinded, and that it would be the secretary-treasurer and the president, whoever that was, just the president.

So we will try to get that taken care of. And if anybody has any questions, I'll try to answer them. Well, I think we're in healthy condition.

Everything is okay. How many members do we have? That's a little sticker that's still on the computer.

Oh. It's approximately the same as we had last year.

[Sharon] (5:43 - 5:44)
Yeah, about 89 or 90?

[Jeanne] (5:44 - 6:17)
No, it's not that. It's still in the 70s. Oh, it's in the 70s.

But it's a good number. It's the percentage of the members who are senior members that make the difference. Right, that's right.

Because seniors pay lower dues. And this is a problem with all organizations. It's a generational thing, too.

Thank you, Gene, for the report.

[Sam] (6:19 - 6:31)
Just so I'm clear, the seven designated funds, are these scholarships? Yes. And those receive money from the operating account?

[Jeanne] (6:32 - 7:24)
No, if a donation is made to one of those funds, it's generally tucked in with the person's conference registration. And that check, because it's made out to PMP&M, has to be deposited into the operating fund. I see.

And the donations are tracked separately. And then after the fiscal year has been tallied up, the donations are pulled out and put into separate funds. So, for example, like the scholarship committee, and that is Heather Nosy, and she has guests, so I called her to see if she was coming.

So she wasn't coming either. Each year I request that donation checks be separate. Always comes with the registration.

[Sam] (7:25 - 7:30)
So they have the option to make it out to the specific fund they wanted to go, but they never do.

[Speaker 7] (7:30 - 7:31)
They wanted to. I see, okay.

[Jeanne] (7:32 - 8:30)
Yeah, and so each, well, like the scholarship fund, Heather Nosy is the chair of that. So she's responsible for that and how much money they have determined. And a lot of it depends on the people who are putting donations into the Danfelser and the Janet Weed.

The Janet Weed children generally will make an annual contribution in honor of their mother, but then sometimes they are kind of short. So that determines how much money is given in those scholarships. And in some years, people don't even apply for them.

You know, that and the Danfelser. The Danfelser, as you know, as Mrs. Danfelser established this organization 74 years ago. And so that was her daughter, Priscilla, who was here that would donate there.

[Sam] (8:31 - 8:35)
And each of these foundations has their own rules for how you apply?

[Jeanne] (8:36 - 8:36)
Yeah, yeah.

[Sam] (8:36 - 8:37)
Are there auditions?

[Jeanne] (8:37 - 8:38)
No.

[Sam] (8:39 - 8:39)
You just apply?

[Jeanne] (8:39 - 8:58)
Yeah, you usually apply, send in an application for the scholarships. The only one that doesn't allow anybody to apply is the Jane Snow Scholarship Fund, and that's designated for gifts to MT&A.

[Sam] (9:03 - 9:06)
So what happens with that fund?

[Jeanne] (9:06 - 9:22)
What happens to it? It's in the bank, and every year a portion of it is sent to MT&A for voice awards. Okay.

For the MT&A National. We simply handle the fund. We don't do anything to it.

[Sam] (9:23 - 9:24)
Is it like an endowment?

[Jeanne] (9:25 - 9:27)
It is. Okay, that makes sense.

[Sam] (9:27 - 9:28)
That's the Jane Snow?

[Jeanne] (9:28 - 9:36)
Yeah, Jane was out of the university, along with Gene, for many years. And she could do everything.

[Sam] (9:38 - 9:42)
So there's a contribution from there to the operating account?

[Jeanne] (9:42 - 9:46)
Yeah, what year did she pass away? Pardon? I didn't understand your question.

[Sam] (9:46 - 9:54)
There's a contribution from that fund to the operating account for the purposes of the voice competition?

[Jeanne] (9:54 - 9:57)
Yes. For the winner. I don't understand your question.

[Sam] (9:58 - 10:00)
Well, what happens to that?

[Jeanne] (10:00 - 10:52)
I don't know. Have you ever registered for the conference? Do you remember that down at the bottom there is a section for contributions?

And all of these funds are listed there. So if anybody wants to make a contribution to the Jane Snow Fund, they find it in that little list on the conference registration, and they put down $10 for their donation. And if that donation is included in their registration check, the whole thing gets into the operating fund, and after the accountant does the year end, any contribution that had gone to the Jane Snow Fund, into the operating fund, is pulled out and placed in the actual Snow account.

Does that make sense?

[Sam] (10:52 - 10:57)
But then you said that the money is used for a voice competition?

[Jeanne] (10:58 - 11:04)
For the MT&A Senior and Young Artists Voice Competitions, the national competitions.

[Sam] (11:05 - 11:13)
So some percentage of that fund comes out each year for the winners, just automatically goes to the winners of those competitions?

[Jeanne] (11:14 - 11:18)
It automatically goes to MT&A and they channel it, yes.

[Sam] (11:19 - 11:23)
But not to the national organizations?

[Jeanne] (11:23 - 12:04)
Yes, that's for the national. How many years has it been since Jane passed away? 2012.

So 13 years. 13 years. I remember we were at our condo in Durango, and somebody, a sandman called me and had heard.

So that fund has done a lot of things. In fact, one of the first winners of the Snow competition at MT&A was a Young Artist winner, who yesterday, or tomorrow afternoon, is singing Figaro in the Met broadcast.

[Sharon] (12:05 - 12:06)
Oh, really?

[Jeanne] (12:08 - 12:11)
So, the fund has done good things.

[Sharon] (12:11 - 12:13)
Let's move on.

[Jeanne] (12:15 - 15:20)
Okay, that is one more report. As I mentioned about Heather and Asya not being here, we need to really have these reports. I just want to go through and tell you, we don't have people in charge, and so I have been just going along and just saying, this is what we have from last year.

And I haven't been doing advertising. I haven't had time, but I always will. Larry did some advertising when he was president.

The archives is open. Awareness and advocacy used to be feral. I assume he'll still do it.

We don't need a state certification chair anymore. That is just a national. They take care of certifications, so Cheryl doesn't have to do that.

College faculty and collegiate chapters is Laura Spitzer. She's retired, down at New Mexico State. And they have somebody who replaced her, who is a doctorate from someplace.

And then, let's see. The composer commissioning program. I don't think we have anybody there.

Oh, that's Melissa Garland. Oh, that's Melissa Garland, yeah. You said she couldn't be here.

She lives here in town, and she's into composing and stuff. And the scholarship, Heather. The handbook I have for Ron, but nobody seems to do much there.

The independent music teacher forum, that's open. Joyce Walker is, you know, Cindy takes care of that. She's the daughter.

MT&A Foundation, well, that is the vice president's position. Memorial Outreach, that was Farrell. And I think he set that up.

So I just sent all these out and said, this is what I'm doing. Pep is Jana. The Segway used to be Diane, and she passed away, and then Doug took it, but like we said, he's no longer going to do that.

We have not had a Segway, either online or a paper. And I've been trying to find an assistant, because Doug wanted somebody to gather the reports and put them together and send to him, and he would put it online. Well, nobody wants to do it.

And they're all got lots of jobs. Student activities, as Terry Reck used to do it, and she still does, I mean. Student honors for the state.

If we don't have a state chair, we don't have honors. He used to do it. Yeah, he said no.

He said no. You did it, didn't you?

[Sam] (15:21 - 15:23)
No, I just did the district, yeah.

[Jeanne] (15:23 - 15:35)
Yeah, no, Larry said he wouldn't do it. Wow, he did it so nice. Yeah, and he bought Tatiana's school, music school.

He bought it?

[Sharon] (15:35 - 15:35)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (15:36 - 15:46)
He and his wife. I kind of, they talk about it. Tatiana has moved to Portugal.

Tatiana moved? Tatiana.

[Speaker 7] (15:46 - 15:47)
Vetrinska, yeah. Yeah.

[Jeanne] (15:49 - 16:30)
Really? And Larry and Tatiana B will do the MT&A competitions. Okay.

And we don't have a webmaster. So, Tristan, ask him, maybe somebody from his school. He has so many teachers in his school.

Maybe he will train somebody because he did MT&A honors for so many years. I know. He's the most knowledgeable person.

Maybe he will, kind of, some teacher from his school. He has quite a few teachers. Yeah, I know.

Talk to him. Just check. Talk to him.

Because we need this position. We need this. Somebody to stay down there.

Yeah.

[Sam] (16:30 - 16:33)
Is there anybody up in Santa Fe who might be interested?

[Jeanne] (16:33 - 17:03)
Santa Fe is kind of an organization, so I don't think so. Who is, who is Natasha? She's actually not a member of MT&A.

She used to be. She's a pianist. Does she teach up there?

She used to teach in Los Alamos and Santa Fe, but she's not teaching now. She's kind of more performing, composing, so doing some stuff, but not. She's not a member anymore.

She used to be.

[Speaker 7] (17:04 - 17:04)
Who's that?

[Jeanne] (17:04 - 17:19)
Natasha Stajanovska. Oh. She used to be.

Yes. And now she's kind of, I try kind of involve her more, but she's doing some. Well, and Melissa Hedman moved, and she was such a good worker.

Oh, Melissa moved a few years ago. She's already moved before pandemic.

[Sharon] (17:19 - 17:20)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (17:20 - 17:46)
Yeah. She moved. Yeah, I know.

Melissa was great. So, well, I've seen a name. Is there Elizabeth or some?

Yes, Elizabeth. We have two actually new teachers. She moved, and I think she's a member, but she was not a member of New Mexico.

She was a member of, she moved from Texas, I think.

[Sharon] (17:47 - 17:47)
Oh.

[Jeanne] (17:47 - 18:01)
And she started putting her student to somewhere. She just established studio. But she needed at least one, two years to kind of assimilate.

[Sharon] (18:01 - 18:01)
Right.

[Jeanne] (18:01 - 18:30)
But she's potentially could be. Yeah, and the Parsons are still up there. Karen.

Karen, yes, but she's kind of slow. She doesn't want to do much stuff. Okay.

I try bring her. And Pat, Patricia Wood. Patty's active.

Patty's active. Patty Teach, she's active, except she doesn't want, she'd be grateful to her. She usually have all events in her house.

She has big house.

[Lori] (18:30 - 18:31)
Right, yeah.

[Jeanne] (18:31 - 18:46)
But she doesn't want to do any big duty, because she not very good with computer. She always have some kind of, I don't want to do any computer stuff. But she's great.

She's helping a lot.

[Sharon] (18:46 - 18:47)
Yeah, well, that's.

[Jeanne] (18:47 - 18:50)
Yeah, we do. And Lori, Lauren Bomse.

[Sharon] (18:51 - 18:54)
Oh, yes. She's our secretary. Oh, good.

[Jeanne] (18:54 - 19:02)
Yeah, because I've asked her. She's really nice, but she doesn't want to do much stuff. I hear that Fred Kronacker back.

[Sharon] (19:03 - 19:03)
Oh, okay.

[Jeanne] (19:04 - 19:08)
Back to town. Hopefully he'll join. I don't know if he member or not.

[Sharon] (19:08 - 19:09)
Who is that, Fred?

[Jeanne] (19:09 - 19:21)
Fred Kronacker. He is a member. He is a member, okay.

Because I know he moved last year in September. He kind of give his studio. And then now he moved back.

[Sharon] (19:21 - 19:22)
Oh.

[Jeanne] (19:22 - 19:24)
Just hear from one of my students.

[Sharon] (19:24 - 19:25)
Okay.

[Jeanne] (19:26 - 19:43)
Well, I mean, this is nice to get some real words about what's going on out here in the state. Because Lori Dockins, I think, has really added a new dimension over there. Now, Farrah and Lori, they're holding that part of the state.

[Sharon] (19:43 - 19:43)
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

[Jeanne] (19:44 - 19:57)
Yeah, but Cheryl isn't. She's retired. Right, right, right.

She's dead. I don't know. I don't know what will be in Los Alamos because Kayvon was president and she's moving and Wendy now in district VP.

[Speaker 7] (19:58 - 19:58)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (19:59 - 20:23)
And we will have meeting tomorrow, right, Wendy? And we'll see what will be in Los Alamos. We have just four official members.

Only four. Used to have, when I came to the state, it was 20. Now just four.

And we will see what will happen, right, Wendy? Well, the younger people aren't teaching.

[Lori] (20:23 - 20:42)
Right, and there are many teachers retired as well, as I know, like Joe Cox. Yeah. Yeah.

He's retiring as well. So many teachers retire and move to other place. So now we just have a few teachers on board.

Right.

[Jeanne] (20:44 - 20:52)
Does organization, does local organization should have a president to exist or not? Do we need to have president?

[Sharon] (20:53 - 20:53)
For a local association?

[Jeanne] (20:53 - 21:16)
Yeah. You are formally organized, you know. There are, yeah, if you see my report, it was that we did add a fourth local association.

And there is legal work with that. And Farrell and this new gal. It's in, all that is in.

[Sharon] (21:16 - 21:17)
In my report.

[Jeanne] (21:18 - 21:19)
In Lori Duncan's report.

[Speaker 7] (21:19 - 21:20)
I get it, I get it.

[Jeanne] (21:20 - 21:55)
She's one of the new members over there at the university. They took the time to do the paperwork. So we have four local association legally.

It would be Los Alamos, Santa Fe, Albuquerque. And now they call it the Eastern Mexican Organization. No, just my question is, if we don't have president, if we have just association without president, would it be, we can do it?

Sure. Just write it as vacant. Okay.

Wendy, what we will do tomorrow, right?

[Lori] (21:56 - 22:24)
Yeah, right. I don't know. I have one thing to say.

I'm just thinking, do we have to combine Santa Fe and Los Alamos association, music teacher association, because now the teacher numbers is decaying. And then for both of the organizations. So do you think that's possible that we combine these two areas?

[Jeanne] (22:24 - 23:45)
It's possible, Wendy, but we have two different treasury. We have two different bank accounts. So we have to consolidate.

So I don't know if it would be really practical. But we will talk about it, because we need to talk who will be. Check with Cincinnati headquarters, MTA.

That's who I checked with for when they were legally going through the formation of the one in the E, over in Fort Tullis. Okay. Yeah, check with them and see how that, and I'm sure it's happening now.

Yeah. It's one district. A little Colorado, you know.

Of course, they have a big population there in Denver. Well, they have 700 members. Arizona has over 500 members.

But yet, the president of Arizona has the same problem. Nobody wants to do anything. They have over 500 members.

Right. Just there in the Phoenix area, basically, and a few in Tucson. And nobody wants to do anything.

So we just go inactive. I've been around other organizations that nobody does a job. They just say you can go inactive.

Remember in the 70s when the Greek system went that way? That would be a sad thing to do one year before we were 75 years old.

[Sharon] (23:45 - 23:45)
Right.

[Jeanne] (23:45 - 25:12)
I know. Well, we'll keep that. And after 75, we can put it on the headstone.

Okay. Any other reports that we have printed there? Okay.

Let's move along here to the conference that we have to have. And just as of yesterday, I learned that the MT&A competitions at the state level, the deadline is November 9th, if you're going to enter the MT&A competitions. And so I was looking at the calendars, so then the weekend before would probably be a good time.

I think the 7th through the 9th would be a good time then to have the state conference. See, we voted to have every other year with a conference. Right.

So this past year we really didn't have a conference. So now we need a conference. But then in 2026, it's our Diamond Jubilee.

So then that's really going to have to pull out all the stoppers and invite people and so forth. Maybe we should, can we skip this year and just do next year? Combine these two conferences?

Just questions. No, we need to have something. Just a one day or even a couple sessions.

We always have to have a board meeting. No, board meeting, yes. Board meeting, yes.

I'm not talking about board meetings. No, no, but we could have the board meeting.

[Sharon] (25:12 - 25:14)
And student activities.

[Jeanne] (25:14 - 25:31)
Yeah, the student activities. And maybe even just have somebody give a presentation. Right.

Because we also have to have the general membership meeting. Right. And so oftentimes what we've done is like, say, Saturday would be all the competitions, the students.

[Sharon] (25:31 - 25:32)
Right, Friday night.

[Jeanne] (25:32 - 25:52)
And then Friday night we could have... Board meeting. Yeah, what we often do is we'll have the board meeting.

And then on Saturday sometimes sneak in a general membership meeting. Sunday. No, not Sunday.

Saturday. Saturday sometime.

[Speaker 7] (25:53 - 25:53)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (25:53 - 26:52)
We've done it like for 45 minutes at noon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y'all bring your sandwiches and have something like that.

Yeah, so kind of just do it. I'm looking at the 7th, 8th, and 9th. I see.

I think the 9th is a Monday, isn't it? No, 9th is Sunday. Is that Sunday?

Okay. Just 7th and 8th. So then it would be the 8th.

Yeah, the 7th and the 8th. And so what would happen, the 8th would be, that's Saturday, that would be the student day. And we would have the general membership somewhere.

Sneak it in, bring a lunch. And then on the 7th, probably like at 4pm, have the board meeting. You can even have a little dinner for dinner time.

Or have a concert, have a recital or something.

[Sharon] (26:52 - 26:52)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Jeanne] (26:52 - 27:10)
We have a recital, usually we have Saturday. No, Saturday. Saturday night is the winter's recital, so it's kind of there.

Are you saying 4pm for the general membership meeting? No, the board meeting, not on Friday. These are just thoughts, it's what you guys...

[Sam] (27:10 - 27:16)
And what is the status of honors if we don't find someone to run that? That just won't happen at the conference?

[Jeanne] (27:17 - 27:20)
Well, maybe each district will want to keep it going.

[Sam] (27:21 - 27:29)
I mean, do the district auditions still happen if there is no state competition? It's preliminary for the state competition.

[Jeanne] (27:30 - 27:38)
I would still suggest that the district have it and the district chairs get together. What do you think?

[Sam] (27:38 - 27:40)
And that will happen at the conference? The finals?

[Jeanne] (27:41 - 30:32)
Yeah, yeah. How can there be finals if there's nobody in charge? Somebody has to run the show.

How about having a committee of all the district chairmen who are doing the honors? Somebody still has to be in charge. How about one of the district vice presidents?

For this year, you can just do it, not like this, just for one year. Talk to, you probably need, Wendy is one of the VP. Wendy, you probably, Cheryl can contact old VP and tell them that this year no one, but talk to Larry, maybe he finds somebody.

He's such a knowledgeable. And then VP can kind of make a turn. Or we could talk to the district vice presidents.

Let them run it. Larry was so wonderful in so many things because he's so extremely well organized. Right, right.

No, but he maybe can trace. Whoever is honors chair has to have the entire repertoire in the computer because they have to, as a winner is declared, they eliminate everybody but the winner in that division or whatever it's called. And that way they have the program for the evening concert.

Because sometimes honors has run until 5.30 when there were a lot of people, especially the pianists. So they finish at 5.30 and the concert starts at 7 or so. The programs have to be run.

And I remember people racing to get that thing printed out from the computer and get to a copy shop and sort of passing out the programs at the concert hot off the press. So there has to be somebody in charge. No, state honors could be a collaboration.

I remember here a few years ago when no one, we didn't have district VP. We just did collaboration kind of, but I lead. Of course somebody needs to take a role, but still I remember when Divan was responsible for all different stuff, we divided duty and did it.

It's good business here at state if you don't have anybody. Just do collaboration because it's no point to have... Well, I can send out another email to the membership and explain the honors situation.

I don't think so. Maybe you're right. Maybe district VPs need to talk to each other and kind of make collaboration.

I think the district vice presidents need more activities.

[Sam] (30:36 - 30:38)
Who are...

[Jeanne] (30:38 - 30:49)
Wendy and I are... Mike Lively and Roswell. Lori Dawkins.

And Laura Spitzer.

[Sam] (30:50 - 30:56)
So those are two separate districts? Roswell and Clovis are two separate...

[Jeanne] (30:56 - 30:57)
Roswell's part of that.

[Sam] (30:58 - 31:00)
So who's the VP?

[Jeanne] (31:01 - 31:06)
No, no. Roswell is southeast, which is like Hobbs.

[Sam] (31:06 - 31:11)
They are different. Mike Lively from southeast.

[Jeanne] (31:11 - 31:12)
Yeah, southeast.

[Sam] (31:12 - 31:14)
And Lori Dawkins from...

[Jeanne] (31:16 - 31:30)
Northeast 2. Northeast 1 is Wendy. I think it's 1 and 2.

I mean, I know there's a 1 and 2. And then Wendy from... And then you from district...

[Sam] (31:30 - 31:31)
Central.

[Jeanne] (31:31 - 31:33)
And then, yeah, Lori Spitzer is southwest.

[Sam] (31:34 - 31:40)
So she retired from the university, but she still has her position in this organization.

[Sharon] (31:40 - 31:41)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Sam] (31:43 - 31:44)
They call it southwest?

[Jeanne] (31:45 - 32:04)
That's southwest. And northwest doesn't have any members. So we have six districts.

Southwest, southeast. Northeast 1, northeast 2. No, and then...

Central. Yeah, central. And then northwest.

[Sam] (32:04 - 32:06)
Northwest, so there's five.

[Jeanne] (32:06 - 32:20)
Yeah, so we don't have any members in northwest. All right. So, let me check.

Let me call Larry and see what words of wisdom he will have.

[Sam] (32:21 - 32:26)
Well, yeah. If it turns out that we're going to get together and do this between the five of us...

[Jeanne] (32:26 - 32:27)
Yeah.

[Sam] (32:27 - 32:33)
...or delegate somebody to do it, we need to know what needs to be done. And Larry's the one who knows all that.

[Jeanne] (32:33 - 32:47)
Yeah. At least plan 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You want to talk to Larry and feel...

Sure, yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll let you do that then, Sam. Just kind of collaboration effort, right?

Yeah, somebody to suggest.

[Sam] (32:48 - 32:53)
I don't imagine I can talk him into getting involved, but he could let me know what needs to be done.

[Jeanne] (32:53 - 33:24)
No, he can give you a list, right, what to do. Uh-huh. List to do, right.

Also, question. Who is responsible for latest e-mail to send? Could you add my e-mail to on the list?

Because I didn't get... Well, that was done. No, because I don't have any.

I deleted my old Russian e-mail. Yeah. But I don't get any e-mail now from any of you.

And then I said, Gene, could you add me to the list? Because, remember, I said I don't get...

[Speaker 7] (33:24 - 33:24)
You are...

[Jeanne] (33:25 - 33:31)
No, but I didn't get Zoom meeting. Well, I didn't send out anything about Zoom. Could you add me, please?

[Chip] (33:32 - 33:38)
I responded to her e-mail. So when she sent her e-mail out to everybody, I responded to that same list.

[Jeanne] (33:38 - 33:41)
Could you just add to list, because I didn't get anything.

[Chip] (33:41 - 33:45)
I will be happy to communicate with you on a personal level.

[Jeanne] (33:45 - 33:48)
No, you don't need personal. Just send me to list.

[Chip] (33:48 - 33:49)
I don't have a list.

[Jeanne] (33:50 - 34:57)
No, she indeed has. She sent out the e-mail. Right, but I didn't get any.

Well, I did not send out any e-mail about Zoom, because... And about invitation. Remember, I sent you.

Wendy told me. I said, when is board meeting? She said, oh, Gene sent it.

I said, I didn't get anything. And then, remember, I sent you and you sent me a personal e-mail. But I don't need personal attention.

I just need to be on a list. You are on the list. No, I'm not.

I didn't get Zoom meeting. I didn't send out anything about Zoom, because this is Chip's project. No, it's a great project.

I feel that it's time we needed two years of any communication. And this association is not doing well. And that's why we just have five of us, but that's better than...

Zoom handles things, but there's no communication. Right, but, you know, when people are out of town, far away, better to have this than nothing, right?

[Sam] (34:57 - 34:58)
I agree.

[Jeanne] (34:59 - 35:01)
Yeah, well, the next president can do what they want.

[Chip] (35:01 - 35:03)
I'm going to type in your e-mail.

[Jeanne] (35:03 - 35:04)
On the top?

[Chip] (35:04 - 35:08)
You can just type it in and you'll get the whole thing. Great.

[Jeanne] (35:08 - 38:02)
Like I said, the next president can do what they want. They can have a Zoom meeting every three months. Okay, so we're talking about the conference now, November 7th and 8th.

I have sketched it out for what we need to get in, the requirements. Now, did maybe Friday night have a concert or some kind of a presentation? Because we have to have the board meeting, I'd say about 4 o'clock.

Then we could eat. We have celebrate Teacher of the Year. Oh, yeah.

Usually we do that a lot, don't we? Usually we do it on Friday night after a board meeting. Okay, Teacher of the Year, good.

And then that, we do it like when we have a concert. And then after that concert. Usually we have board meeting at 4, then we go to dinner about 5, a concert at 6 or 7.

Yeah. And we have so many great pianists here in New Mexico. I was thinking.

Somebody, somebody. Even we have some women composers, like in Santa Fe they do Natasha Stojanovska. We have Lauren who composed.

We have some. We can do some. We used to have a New Mexico Women Composers Guild.

Yeah, they do maybe some. Many of them have passed on and moved away. So that would be then the sketch for the seventh night.

So what we have to do then is decide if we want a concert, or we will want a concert. And then after, well, the program. We'll have the Teacher of the Year, and then we'll have, we don't have a commission composer.

That's oftentimes when we would have the commission work. Usually for a commission composer, that has to be a year or two out. So there, that's what we will need, a commission piece for 2026.

Oh, nice, yes. For the Silver Anniversary. So now who would we want for a commission composer?

There is, we would have to look back through the minutes, and could possibly ask Ron who it is. A person was asked to be the commission composer, and things kept falling through. That person is still hanging out there someplace.

That would be, the polite thing would be to ask that person first. Right. If still willing to do it.

Was that Melissa? No, no. I don't, it was a name I didn't know.

Yeah, it doesn't pop into your head.

[Speaker 7] (38:02 - 38:03)
You remember that.

[Jeanne] (38:04 - 38:48)
No, we had Kathleen Ryan who composed for us, Sonatina. Kathleen Ryan, she lived in mountain range. And she composed for Santa Fe, Sonatina, that we used in our sonata contest.

But there is some composers I know who compose actively, but it would be nice to have local. I think this is a person that Madeline Williamson first contacted, and then it sort of got moved and COVID came along. I can look through old paper.

Yeah, we did, she did. I don't recall now. Would you want to check on that with Ron?

Ron Greenash? Yeah, see if he remembers. Okay.

Composer of the year for conference of 2020. Yeah, commission composer. Commission composer.

[Sam] (38:50 - 38:53)
You said Mike Malden isn't feeling well these days.

[Jeanne] (38:53 - 38:53)
No.

[Sam] (38:53 - 38:58)
I would put him on your list, though. He's the only composer I know. Dennis Alexander.

[Jeanne] (38:59 - 39:02)
Dennis, yeah. He just lives around the corner here.

[Sam] (39:04 - 39:05)
Check with Ron. Dennis moved over here?

[Jeanne] (39:06 - 39:44)
Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. I think Gene sees him.

Dennis. Yes, he's very active. Yeah, we can ask him.

Has 18 students. Wow. He's a busy guy.

Is he still doing Dennis Alexander competition? No. In other states.

Oh, up there? I don't know about here, but other states. And he had a student in the Jackie McGee competition.

A young man. That's him there. Okay, I'll check with Ron.

Yeah, you will check with Ron. See what the status is there.

[Sam] (39:44 - 39:58)
So the honors, finals, the MTNA preliminaries, concert, commission piece, that would be separate from the recital?

[Jeanne] (40:00 - 40:03)
No, commission piece would be for 26.

[Sam] (40:04 - 40:08)
So for this year, though, we're not looking for a commission piece?

[Jeanne] (40:08 - 40:16)
No, no, no. We're going to keep it pretty simple this year. We have to have something this year because of the bylaws.

[Sam] (40:16 - 40:20)
So who is the director of the conference? Is that the president?

[Jeanne] (40:21 - 40:28)
The president, and then committees will be delegated on special projects.

[Sam] (40:30 - 40:32)
Do you have a venue in mind?

[Jeanne] (40:34 - 40:35)
For this year?

[Sam] (40:36 - 40:37)
Yeah, for this year.

[Jeanne] (40:37 - 40:40)
Yeah, I mentioned that. Four o'clock on Friday.

[Sam] (40:40 - 40:41)
He said venue.

[Jeanne] (40:41 - 41:32)
Oh, venue. I'm sorry. No, but you know, that's Veterans Day, and I wonder if the academy would be...

But it's not veterans. Veterans 11. Well, yeah, but sometimes they have a school.

Yeah, right, right. I mean, who knows? These schools.

Well, my granddaughters in Colorado can't have any holidays, but they're having no school today or Monday. Whereas, you know, you can't get off for Easter or anything like that. And it's sort of like that over here at the academy.

Because I got the name from a student the other day, somebody who's... But they keep changing, too, the people who are over there in the administration. I had, two years ago, a very nice venue.

This was a conference a couple of years ago. Where? At the academy?

No, no, no, no. We had a conference.

[Speaker 7] (41:33 - 41:34)
Oh! Oh, yeah!

[Jeanne] (41:35 - 41:40)
Such a beautiful place. Oh, is that... We go by it all the time.

Because it's... We go down the hill.

[Sharon] (41:40 - 41:41)
It's great. Parking, parking lots.

[Jeanne] (41:42 - 41:51)
Constitution... No. We go down.

It's Comanche to Louisiana. We go by the building all the time. It's a nice place.

Massive parking lot.

[Speaker 7] (41:51 - 41:51)
Yes.

[Jeanne] (41:51 - 41:54)
It's just... Great location, nice parking lot.

[Sharon] (41:54 - 41:54)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (41:54 - 42:02)
Well, I could check to see. We'd have to have pianos moved in. Yeah.

But... Which church is this? Oh, we're talking about...

[Speaker 7] (42:02 - 42:05)
It's not a church, it's a... I don't know what it's called. I don't know what it's called.

[Jeanne] (42:07 - 42:08)
It's some kind of... Yeah.

[Speaker 7] (42:09 - 42:09)
Some kind of ground.

[Jeanne] (42:10 - 42:14)
The one thing you have to bear in mind, if this is going to be a tiny conference...

[Sharon] (42:14 - 42:15)
Yes.

[Jeanne] (42:15 - 42:21)
Which it sounds like it's going to be. Do you want to spend $2,400 on a venue?

[Sharon] (42:23 - 42:23)
No.

[Sam] (42:23 - 42:33)
So, yeah, that's a very good consideration. That's where the academy would be and that's what Faccio was. Yeah, yeah.

They were about the same?

[Speaker 7] (42:33 - 42:33)
Mm-hmm.

[Sam] (42:34 - 42:44)
So what we need is an auditorium and for the competitions, would that happen in the auditorium? We could do them in smaller rooms if we needed to, right?

[Jeanne] (42:45 - 42:48)
Well, usually we have a larger room.

[Sam] (42:48 - 42:51)
Larger. So one auditorium is what we need.

[Jeanne] (42:52 - 42:52)
Yeah.

[Sam] (42:52 - 42:53)
Basically.

[Jeanne] (42:53 - 43:02)
And you can't use churches because they have Saturday night churches. Well, ours does and most churches do now.

[Sam] (43:04 - 43:22)
So that narrows it down. But I agree, I think, especially since there's going to be one next year. We want to do this with a streamlined...

Save a little money. Hopefully have good judges but not put money on a lot of other frills.

[Jeanne] (43:22 - 43:35)
Yeah, you have to keep up the quality of the judges. You can invite Laura Spitzer if she doesn't have anybody. She's such a great judge.

Who? Laura Spitzer. Oh, yeah.

She's such a great judge.

[Sam] (43:35 - 43:49)
Is the budget for judges at the state level for the final competition, is it different? I know... It's a line item.

We pay $50 an hour for the district level. What is it for the state?

[Jeanne] (43:49 - 43:49)
The same.

[Sam] (43:49 - 43:55)
It's the same? It makes it hard to get somebody from out of state to do it for you.

[Jeanne] (43:55 - 44:17)
Well, see, that's where we have a judge for this coming year. They could do a Friday night little program. Durango, don't forget Fort Lewis.

They have some amazing people up there. I go to Durango a lot. We used to have a house.

And they have wonderful faculty there. They have a piano gal who's been down here.

[Sam] (44:18 - 44:25)
So if there's one judge and they play the concert Friday night, then we can pay them a lot more.

[Jeanne] (44:25 - 44:29)
Then they could also do the... Well, they can pay for the concert, and then they'd be paid for judging.

[Sam] (44:30 - 44:31)
And what can we pay them for the concert?

[Jeanne] (44:33 - 44:46)
You negotiate that. You have to negotiate, but usually it's very little. And in the past, the judges haven't always been the people giving the concert.

They've done master classes.

[Sam] (44:49 - 44:54)
Okay, but there isn't a limit on what we can pay them for that. It's a negotiation.

[Jeanne] (44:55 - 45:28)
You have to figure out what they would like to have versus what you can afford to pay. Sometimes... There are different grants.

I have discovered that the Bank of Albuquerque provides grants. And I have the name of the person who's in charge of those. So if somebody wanted to put together a grant for a certain need at a certain time and asks so much money, we could submit it.

[Sam] (45:29 - 45:33)
Would that just come with advertising for the Bank of Albuquerque?

[Jeanne] (45:33 - 45:34)
Oh, I'm sure it would.

[Sam] (45:34 - 45:36)
Just be a donation, basically.

[Jeanne] (45:36 - 45:43)
Yeah, it's a donation they have. So that's something I found in my notes.

[Sam] (45:43 - 45:57)
The more... I mean, with a strict limit like $50 an hour, that means we can't negotiate for the districts. But if it's combined with other things and we can negotiate, that's just...

[Jeanne] (45:57 - 46:17)
You're saying district. The district is different from the state. What I'm talking about is what's in the state budget.

What the districts pay their judges, that's a district thing. We pay you and you pay the state. The district has its own budget.

[Sam] (46:19 - 46:24)
Yes, I was talking about the district preliminaries for the Congress.

[Jeanne] (46:24 - 46:28)
That's what I'm talking about. Yours would come through Central District.

[Sam] (46:29 - 46:32)
I thought I was limited to $50 an hour.

[Jeanne] (46:32 - 46:33)
You probably are.

[Sam] (46:33 - 46:36)
But it's their rules, not this organization's.

[Jeanne] (46:36 - 46:55)
They don't... The rules for paying judges in order to keep it equitable is $50. If a district wants to pay more, as long as they pay the basic $50, I would think they could pay more.

[Sam] (46:56 - 47:03)
Okay. But I would need to talk to them. So it's just a question of how much money the organization has.

[Jeanne] (47:03 - 47:16)
The district has. That's a different account than what AMTA has. So you have to have your own little account.

And AMTA seems to have money.

[Sam] (47:18 - 47:37)
Well, it's the biggest district. But I'll talk to them. But as far as the state conference, I think probably all of us have some friends from out of state who would be wonderful judges.

But we have to be able to pay them.

[Jeanne] (47:38 - 48:36)
In Colorado, usually they drive quite a few times. Like Elmhurst or Elmhurst. You see, last year we had the good fortune of having some donors, which enabled us to bring in the pianist who played the evening concert.

And that was paid for totally by donations. A couple of thousand dollar donations from individuals. Was that a separate fundraising effort?

No, it was just a matter of asking. It was Larry that was asking. And one of them was a person who had heard this pianist once before and said, I'd like to hear him again.

So here's a thousand dollars. This year, depending on what happens in the financial world, everything may be cut back. Still don't ask, maybe.

Ask, like you said, ask.

[Sam] (48:38 - 49:12)
So if these fundraising efforts weren't directed towards a singular thing, like getting this particular performer to come and perform and judge, he was a judge too, but also if we're having these same kind of efforts to go directly to the treasury or to contribute to an endowment or create a new endowment, what can we do towards that? I mean, it sounds like Larry's the person who knows how to do it. Maybe other people do too.

[Jeanne] (49:13 - 49:19)
Larry was good at many things, but the asking of this one donor came from Tatiana.

[Sam] (49:22 - 49:24)
Her friend heard this performer?

[Jeanne] (49:24 - 51:38)
No, no, that's a person who's not even connected with the organization. It's an outside person who had heard him. But Tatiana worked to get the money from an individual.

Nobody's going to give money if you don't ask them. And if you want to be a good fundraiser, line up some people and ask. I don't know about you, but how many asks do you get in the mail every day?

I would say I get at least four. Every animal organization on earth has my address. That's true.

With the structure of boards, there's a little rule that a board's job is to hire the one at the top, and that person does everything else. But a board member's duty is to give, get, or get off. So if we want to give some money, that's fine.

If we don't, we need to ask other people to give us some. And if we're not willing to do that to help the organization, then we try to get off. Several years ago, we had somebody that was a French pianist.

Remember, he was over at Eastern. And so his performance over at Eastern worked into our conference. So I paid for him to come here out of the family trust.

I think it was $750. So then he did his thing at Eastern, and then he came over here and played. So that's another thing to think about or to see, what we have going on in the states around us.

You're talking about a judge for this year, MTN, kind of, right?

[Sam] (51:38 - 51:41)
I mean, there'll be several judges that we'll need.

[Jeanne] (51:42 - 51:44)
Two, at least two.

[Sam] (51:44 - 51:45)
For piano.

[Jeanne] (51:45 - 51:48)
Two for piano, one for voice if it's Austrian.

[Sam] (51:49 - 51:51)
At least one for each.

[Speaker 7] (51:51 - 51:53)
If there's people who do them.

[Jeanne] (51:54 - 52:33)
We have some good voice people at UNM. Jamie and Olga. They're fantastic.

Their daughter studies with me, and I do sodomy too. I said, you guys won't last here long. They came from Ohio or something, and they just love it here.

But they could be at Indiana, so they're just amazing. You have a good pianist at UNM now who is primarily doing accompanying, but who has joined MTNA. And that's James Harder.

[Sam] (52:37 - 52:40)
Is that new? Did that just happen?

[Jeanne] (52:41 - 53:43)
It happened. He joined in the fall or last spring. He's been here a while.

He didn't want to be a starving musician all the time, so he was working in New York, wasn't he? He is a wonderful pianist. He's working with a lot of the UNM students, and the students love him.

For a judge, it needs to be a judge who likes young people. Who can write comments that are really helpful. And knowing them.

He's Jim Harder. I would say he's probably in his 60s. Been around the block a few times.

Heard a lot of pianists. He's worked with my piano students. He needs to know how to do it.

Teaching, not just playing.

[Sam] (53:45 - 53:50)
Always alert for names that could be judges for the Central District Honors.

[Jeanne] (53:55 - 54:04)
Who does the vocal? Who does the vocal association? I'm trying to think.

Oh, Miguel. Who does the vocal?

[Chip] (54:04 - 54:05)
Jackie.

[Jeanne] (54:05 - 54:33)
Jackie. That's been very successful. Yes, the vocal artistry has been very successful.

And has solicited a lot of donors, a lot of business donors. But somebody had to ask. And it's not fun to ask.

[Sam] (54:33 - 54:37)
Is there anybody who is asking, whose job is to ask?

[Jeanne] (54:38 - 54:42)
Everybody's job is to ask if you want to raise money.

[Sam] (54:48 - 54:56)
Well, probably all of us could be involved, but we should do it in a coordinated way so we're not asking the same people, each of us asking the same person over and over.

[Sharon] (54:56 - 54:58)
Oh, I don't think that would be an issue.

[Sam] (55:00 - 55:03)
Do we have a list of people we can ask?

[Jeanne] (55:03 - 55:16)
No, no. I don't think that would be an issue. It just could be unexpected.

Just some friends. Like with Wendy we will talk. We have some Los Alamos people who donate sometimes, but you need to talk to them.

[Sam] (55:16 - 55:22)
Ask your dentist. You can go and look at a program for Santa Fe Opera or the symphony.

[Jeanne] (55:22 - 55:24)
Oh, I would not go there. That's bullshit.

[Sam] (55:25 - 55:27)
But you see who is giving money to them.

[Jeanne] (55:27 - 56:04)
If you look at Jackie Zanderwall's website for vocal artistry, her donors are listed there. Those would be people we could ask? Well, they're people who have given to music.

Look at the symphony program. And to voice. But I also want to be a cheerleader and get all the other people doing these things too.

We just can't feel it. I mean, I can't do any more than I already am.

[Sam] (56:05 - 56:12)
Well, is there any young person in the organization, not an officer, who maybe would be interested in doing something like this?

[Jeanne] (56:13 - 56:28)
Well, AMTA, like I said, the new gal, I don't know if she's president, secretary or something. Alyssa? Yeah, Alyssa.

Alyssa just had... Alyssa Person? You're talking about her?

Yeah. I contacted her actually about... But she had baby in March.

[Speaker 7] (56:29 - 56:29)
Oh.

[Jeanne] (56:29 - 56:40)
She has fully occupied with her baby now. Is that like number four? I don't know.

But I asked her yesterday actually about Chloris. Do you go to the AMTA meetings?

[Sam] (56:40 - 56:42)
No, I haven't been to one.

[Jeanne] (56:42 - 56:58)
Well, maybe you could go to a meeting and find out why AMTA doesn't participate more at the state level. I mean, it's the largest association in the state.

[Sam] (57:00 - 57:05)
Don't they? They don't participate? I mean, don't most of the finalists come from the central division?

[Jeanne] (57:05 - 1:00:30)
Oh, I'm not talking about performers. I'm talking about why the members of AMTA seem almost allergic to the state organization. Don't they rarely participate in the conference?

Surprisingly. It's in our publicity, right? We talk about it.

Asking for chairs. If it's some personality grievance they have, the board needs to know what the state organization is doing that they don't like or they'd like to see done differently. Okay.

Yeah, that's actually a good question. You know, we don't ever really want to deal in personalities, but we need to know if there's something that's... We need to know the root of the problem.

The root of how, if we can... The root of the problem. Because so many of us are, like I said, we've done all these, like Astrid.

She's been... Oh, Astrid is great, yeah. Yeah, I mean, she...

I think a lot of us have other things to do. But no, everybody does. I ask actually quite a few.

I ask Anne Greer. I ask about some teacher, if she can come. And everybody, different excuses.

Everybody busy, busy, busy. Busy time of the year, of course. End of the year.

Same with Dennis Alexander. I think they travel a lot, too. Dennis and Alexander, they travel a lot.

So, I think I... So, these are my thoughts, our thoughts and discussions so far. For the 2025 conference, we have to have one, and it's going to basically cover the legal entities.

On Friday at four o'clock, we would have the board meeting. And then dinner at five. And then have a concert and Teacher of the Year.

Is that what we've talked about? What I have done. And then Saturday, we would have all the student days, and then we have to have a general membership meeting.

General board meeting first, and then you take the agenda from the board meeting to the general membership meeting. If you have time and good judge, you can have master class. Always welcome.

I love to hear some... So, and then that would be 2000, and then we have to find a venue. I know one time, there was a church.

Not all churches have Saturday nights. It's up by La Cueva. We used to have Shiley.

She was a teacher years ago, and then they moved. She and I would run around and have a lot of fun. She reminded me of my daughter.

There was a church up there. It was some Chinese church. I remember they had a great piano, and she and I looked at some concert or something up there.

[Sam] (1:00:31 - 1:00:32)
Has this ever happened at UNM?

[Jeanne] (1:00:34 - 1:01:03)
Well, you know, we did have last year. Tatiana Bee was able to get the recital there. And we had state owner there.

We had state owner, and we had... That just depends on if we have somebody. Oh, yeah.

Jim Harder, he's out of staff there. Well, he's not really in the faculty. Tatiana, if she had such good luck one year, she probably would another.

[Sharon] (1:01:03 - 1:01:03)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:01:04 - 1:01:21)
And the person who seems to be in charge of Keller Hall now says that they have a good feeling toward us, toward music organizations that want to use Keller Hall, and they keep the rate really low.

[Sam] (1:01:22 - 1:01:26)
Is it possible that would be less than some place like the Academy? Oh, yes.

[Jeanne] (1:01:28 - 1:01:30)
Well, at least for the concert, we could probably get Keller Hall.

[Janna] (1:01:30 - 1:01:30)
Oh.

[Jeanne] (1:01:34 - 1:01:38)
No, but what... It was some concert, some big concert.

[Sharon] (1:01:38 - 1:01:41)
I remember that, yes. It was one of the Broadway shows.

[Jeanne] (1:01:42 - 1:02:37)
Yes, because I was there, and I kept... Yeah, and it was so crowded. There was no parking.

I parked somewhere on the street. Yeah, I remember that. It was quite crowded.

Some tourist show that had come through. Yeah, it was very crowded there. If there's anything big in Polk Joy...

Yeah, it's there. Chances of parking for anything in the evening in Keller is slim. And it was even inside crowded, and then we need at least some place to meet and go something.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that... We used to on Saturdays, but...

Not boring at all. I have a question about Friday. Okay.

Friday would just be the board, is that right? Yes, yes. Then you're going to have a recital for just the board?

No, some members will arrive with somebody out of town.

[Sharon] (1:02:38 - 1:02:41)
Well, what could we do then?

[Jeanne] (1:02:41 - 1:04:02)
I'm thinking of... I always think about the money. Yeah, right.

If this Friday evening event is for a questionable-sized audience, do we really want to spend the money to rent a venue for that? The board meeting can be in a home. Or some of the restaurants have a meeting place, I've discovered.

Well... I'm just questioning this evening recital. If it's just some of our members playing for the rest of the board, which is a jolly good idea, that could be in somebody's home where there's a big living room with a piano, rather than in a hall.

Because I would doubt very many people are going to come in for the Saturday events on Friday night to come to a recital. Can there be a required commencement? If you don't have to come in on Friday night, you'll avoid that hotel expense that you normally would have.

[Sharon] (1:04:05 - 1:04:07)
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[Jeanne] (1:04:07 - 1:04:59)
It's a little different from the days when we had a conference that sort of started on Friday, and even went through Sunday morning. But if this is a board meeting, the awarding of a Teacher of the Year, and supper... Well, we could just put it all on Saturday, start at 8 o'clock in the morning, with...

Please don't. Well, it'd have to be by 9 for sure, and have the board meeting from 9 to 10, and then honors would go on all day. They basically do.

But Sharon, board members from a distance are going to have an 8 o'clock morning meeting.

[Sharon] (1:05:00 - 1:05:00)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:05:00 - 1:05:09)
Some of them would want to come in the night before, so they'd be here Friday afternoon, and then be well-rested for Saturday.

[Sharon] (1:05:10 - 1:05:10)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:05:11 - 1:06:08)
A lot of the kids are not out of state. I'm not talking about them, I'm talking about the board. No, no, I know, but sometimes the teachers will come in with the kids too.

Like, Michael Adler usually has winners down there, and the grandmother too, the students who usually win, goes to our church, so I see a lot. So, you know, they all come on in, the teacher and the family and the whole... Kind of make a weekend of it from out of town.

All right! And that's another whole angle. So, now what are your thoughts?

I think the Friday afternoon board meeting is a good idea, with supper afterwards, so people get to know each other a little bit. And a recital by our members, I think, is really appealing. It's a question of where that recital is going to be.

[Janna] (1:06:13 - 1:06:15)
So, can you ladies hear me?

[Chip] (1:06:15 - 1:06:17)
Hello, Laurie. Welcome.

[Janna] (1:06:17 - 1:06:18)
Hi!

[Chip] (1:06:18 - 1:06:19)
Nice to... Welcome.

[Janna] (1:06:20 - 1:06:24)
I didn't know... I hated to interrupt. I didn't want to interrupt anybody.

[Chip] (1:06:24 - 1:06:25)
No.

[Janna] (1:06:26 - 1:07:00)
I just... I have several thoughts here that I wanted to bring up. First of all, when y'all were talking about donations, donations can be absolutely anybody.

Anybody that loves music. You know, that... Jean Grealish is right.

You know, it can be your dentist. I've seen my husband has donated small amounts to a lot of different places, and he's a veterinarian. Can y'all hear me okay?

[Chip] (1:07:01 - 1:07:01)
Yes. Yeah. Yes.

[Janna] (1:07:02 - 1:08:04)
Okay. So, that was my first point. My next one is...

I'm a little bit confused. Are we making the convention all about honors, and honors only? Because if you don't have any...

If you don't have anybody in honors... Like, my kids... I have nearly 30 students, and I don't have anybody that's really eligible for honors.

And so, if you don't have anybody in honors, then there's no reason to come at all. Especially if there's no recital, if there's no nothing, you know, except for honors, then there's no reason for the other teachers around the state to attend. So, you know, I get the trying to save money and everything, but, you know, if we would charge enough for our conference and make it something desirable to come to, I would hope people would attend.

[Sam] (1:08:05 - 1:08:07)
Do your students participate in MTNA?

[Janna] (1:08:08 - 1:08:08)
Huh?

[Sam] (1:08:08 - 1:08:11)
Do your students participate in MTNA?

[Janna] (1:08:12 - 1:08:23)
No. No, my kids just... They participate in PAP, and I don't know if Jenna had a chance to tell anybody, but we're having a hard time getting a judge.

[Jeanne] (1:08:23 - 1:08:30)
No, I know, and actually, over here, hi. Sam, just we'll talk about it. We'll talk with him.

[Sam] (1:08:30 - 1:08:33)
She asked me. I already asked my wife, but...

[Janna] (1:08:33 - 1:08:33)
Okay.

[Jeanne] (1:08:33 - 1:08:35)
We're hoping, we're hoping.

[Janna] (1:08:37 - 1:08:48)
Okay, we would love to have you. Yeah, we would love to have you if you can come, Sam. Farrell Roberts mentioned that he sure would like for you to come over here.

So you can be their guest.

[Sam] (1:08:48 - 1:08:49)
Well, that would be very nice.

[Janna] (1:08:49 - 1:08:50)
That would be great.

[Sam] (1:08:51 - 1:08:57)
If I can, I will. I would like that very much, but I can't commit to it now.

[Jeanne] (1:08:58 - 1:09:01)
He will let us know in a few, next few days.

[Janna] (1:09:01 - 1:09:06)
Yeah, ask the boss. Exactly, exactly what I said.

[Jeanne] (1:09:06 - 1:09:16)
Actually, I asked quite a few teachers, and it seems like everybody is so busy in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, and we keep looking for.

[Janna] (1:09:17 - 1:09:45)
Right, and I appreciate that, and this is not Jana's fault at all. We had a judge all lined up, and they backed out at the very last minute here. So it's not Jana's fault that we don't have a judge.

Thank you, Lori. She's trying. No, I did.

You're trying. And I would also, I would turn on my video, but I'm having technology problems. I even called my brother and tried to get him to turn on my video.

[Chip] (1:09:47 - 1:09:52)
You've got a little happy picture, and it looks like you're in New York with a coffee, so you're very official.

[Janna] (1:09:53 - 1:10:22)
That was a happy picture. I was in New York City. Anyway, I don't know.

As far as recital, I had a suggestion. If you need somebody to perform, and that's Dr. Marina Van Gogh. We heard her play the piano in January, and she's all about Spanish music.

She's very, very good.

[Sam] (1:10:22 - 1:10:26)
Is she at Eastern New Mexico? She's at Eastern.

[Janna] (1:10:26 - 1:12:02)
She is. This is her first year there. She's a go-getter.

I mean, she has done workshops. I mean, I don't know. She's doing master classes and all kinds of things over there.

Just things that, as far as I know, were not going on before. She goes out of the country to do master classes. I don't know if she does workshops or what she does, but she's always at another university or out of the state, out of the country doing events.

She's a possibility to play for a recital. It's somebody that most of us have not heard. I mean, most of the rest of the state.

I don't know if there's any possibility of getting somebody to do... To me, the thing that would make it worth coming on a Friday would be to have something besides a board meeting. I'm not a big meeting person, I guess.

Board meetings are... I don't know. They're not something everybody jumps up and goes down and goes, Yippee, let's go do this.

You're right. Not only here.

[Sam] (1:12:02 - 1:12:06)
So, what would interest you?

[Janna] (1:12:07 - 1:13:26)
You know, well... I know we probably can't afford her, but okay, Arizona is having Irina Gorin. To me, that...

If I could go... I think they already had her. I don't know if they did or if it's coming up.

You guys know who Irina Gorin is? She's a pianist who teaches up in Indianapolis, and she just has a lot of... She works with kids, and so she just has a lot of ideas about technique.

So somebody that could come do a technique workshop and help me with... I mean, this is super specific, but my kids have a hard time... I started in kindergarten.

They have a hard time with hand position. Just somebody who would be willing to come do a workshop for us on technique or business practices, maybe. I know we don't want a whole afternoon of IRS stuff, but just things on how to run a studio.

I don't know.

[Jeanne] (1:13:26 - 1:13:44)
This might be a wonderful idea for the Silver Anniversary. In 26, I'd give us a chance to make a contact and delegate a lot of time to that. If we can get her name and address, send it to me on email.

[Janna] (1:13:45 - 1:13:50)
Are you talking about Irina? Yeah. I'll see what I can find out.

[Sam] (1:13:50 - 1:13:58)
To be a little more general, Laurie, it's a workshop you'd be most interested in versus a concert or a master class or all of the above?

[Janna] (1:13:59 - 1:14:28)
I like all of the above. That's what draws me to conferences. We'll have more of that than Friday afternoon.

It's somewhere to learn. Friday afternoon. You know, that's just what I think a conference should be.

I think it should be more about who are the top kids in the state because those are so few. Laurie, you're right.

[Jeanne] (1:14:28 - 1:14:48)
Sorry, Laurie. You're absolutely right, but two years ago was a wonderful conference and it was quite a few presenters. And great presenters.

They had this from Colorado. Anyway, and it was about four or five people.

[Janna] (1:14:49 - 1:14:50)
Really?

[Jeanne] (1:14:50 - 1:14:51)
Yes.

[Janna] (1:14:51 - 1:14:58)
Did you attend? So we're just not getting people out to come to the conferences. Is that what you're saying, Jana?

Two years ago, yes.

[Jeanne] (1:14:58 - 1:15:09)
And the concert was full, of course. I didn't even have kids for honor, but I attended because I was close. I went to board meetings.

Yes, I was there.

[Janna] (1:15:09 - 1:15:13)
So you had better attendance at the concert than the actual workshops?

[Jeanne] (1:15:14 - 1:15:25)
No, workshop. I actually asked about master class would be great to listen. Yes, I attend all workshop and all master class, but it was not so many people.

Did you attend and it was lots of people?

[Chip] (1:15:25 - 1:15:27)
I attended everything in 2023.

[Jeanne] (1:15:29 - 1:15:30)
2023, 2020.

[Chip] (1:15:31 - 1:15:32)
The last one that we had.

[Jeanne] (1:15:32 - 1:15:35)
And we have Laurie in it. But it was not so many people.

[Chip] (1:15:35 - 1:15:42)
It was terrible. There were so many people who didn't come because it wasn't a conference. It was a competition.

[Sam] (1:15:42 - 1:15:43)
Was the venue too big?

[Jeanne] (1:15:43 - 1:15:45)
The venue was great. The venue was big.

[Sam] (1:15:45 - 1:15:47)
So we need to maybe be a little more intimate.

[Jeanne] (1:15:47 - 1:15:52)
Small, right. Of course, it was some, but it was no more than 10 people.

[Chip] (1:15:52 - 1:15:59)
It was a competition. It wasn't a conference. That's why people don't come because, like Laurie said, people want to come to...

[Jeanne] (1:15:59 - 1:16:12)
No, but it was a very workshop. I know he wanted great workshop about some, yes, prodigy, and he wanted... And then we have...

I forgot his name. There were quite a few workshops. It was quite a few.

[Chip] (1:16:12 - 1:16:14)
I attended all of them. They were very badly attended.

[Jeanne] (1:16:15 - 1:16:35)
Yes, very badly attended. And I say, actually, it started declining. It started declining, declining, declining year by year.

I remember conference in Los Alamos 15 years ago and Santa Fe. And I went to Farrell. I go to all conference.

Yes, I've been there. Well, it's the issue of membership. Right, it's just declining.

[Sharon] (1:16:36 - 1:16:36)
It's a national problem.

[Jeanne] (1:16:36 - 1:16:42)
And if you bring some people and we'll do... Maybe we should plan for 2026, big two-day full conference.

[Sharon] (1:16:43 - 1:16:43)
Yes, a lot of...

[Jeanne] (1:16:43 - 1:16:55)
This would be great for 2026. Yes, but next year, but this year, I don't know, guys. I just worry that it will be again lots of organization, lots of money, and people will not be attending much.

[Janna] (1:16:57 - 1:17:16)
Right. Okay. Well, and, you know, maybe people just start attending workshops because they can watch them online now.

I don't know. I don't know. I mean, you can get on MTNA and watch, you know, all kinds of workshops.

And same thing with Francis Clark Center.

[Jeanne] (1:17:16 - 1:17:22)
No, but they need to do online. We need to bring them. They need to be, like, it's more, like...

Right?

[Janna] (1:17:23 - 1:17:36)
It's good too. Maybe less money. But I understand about the low attendance because we had the same thing when we had the conference here in Clovis.

You know, we had really good presenters and we just didn't have a good turnout.

[Jeanne] (1:17:36 - 1:17:40)
Yeah, you have great presenters. Yeah, I've been there too in Clovis.

[Janna] (1:17:42 - 1:17:43)
So, I don't know.

[Jeanne] (1:17:44 - 1:18:42)
In sort of long-range planning, in a couple of months, we'll know how our membership is going to go because membership renewals went out for April. And if there is a financial crisis, I think people are just not going to join MTNA. And when you get this little bill for over $100 for dues, somebody with a family is going to think twice.

Is this where the money needs to go? But time will tell. And then we'll know more what we can aim for for 2026.

I think that, you know, like I said, 2026, your suggestion would be just ideal of this person doing the master class. We want to aim for that. Unfortunately, it isn't this fall.

[Chip] (1:18:43 - 1:19:16)
That flyer for the Arizona conference was so... Oh, Lori, you made a noise. It was so beautiful.

And it looked like that the focus of the conference was bringing people together to talk together and to learn, yeah, there was the guests, but there was the community, and the focus of the conference was the community. That's what I liked about the Arizona advertisement. I would want to go to that conference.

It looked like I would learn something and maybe be able to contribute.

[Jeanne] (1:19:17 - 1:19:22)
Well, what do we do? Ask every member to show up and do a five-minute presentation?

[Chip] (1:19:22 - 1:20:34)
Well, for this year, if we're considering things to plan for a big thing, I know that at nationals, they've encouraged us to think, how do we have online conferences? How do we have district conferences? Everybody on our membership, we're all contributors.

We all have things that we can contribute. Everybody can say, I can share a paragraph on this. I can share an hour on this.

I can share 10 minutes on this. Or here is a list of ideas that I would like. If this conference had this topic, I would want to show up at this.

Maybe I'd want to show up at this topic. At least we could get some feedback from people. And then conferences, we should start small.

We should be able to have conferences with our neighbors. You mentioned, like, there's a lot of people in Albuquerque, can we build trust with our neighbors and say, okay, let's learn together. And then if a friend of ours in Santa Fe wants to join the Albuquerque meeting, they can pop on.

[Sharon] (1:20:34 - 1:20:35)
We're talking about PNTN.

[Chip] (1:20:36 - 1:20:37)
Yes, me too.

[Sharon] (1:20:39 - 1:20:44)
We're working on our professional growth.

[Chip] (1:20:44 - 1:20:45)
Yes.

[Jeanne] (1:20:47 - 1:20:49)
I'm not going to take time from my neighbors.

[Chip] (1:20:50 - 1:20:57)
No, I meant our, not our next door neighbors, I meant our professional neighbors in Albuquerque.

[Jeanne] (1:20:57 - 1:23:10)
But that has already come up in the question about why AMTA doesn't participate. That's what actually, he's exactly talking about this. And AMTA, maybe they can, what you can do that they join and bring something and come to a conference.

I belong to an organization that has a conference every May. And they go around the state, there's probably about 60 small organizations. And they just tell you, okay, at 2 o'clock May 10th, you are in charge of the presentation from 2 to 3 or something.

It can be Gallup, it can be Santa Fe, it can be down in Las Cruces. And you're just expected to show up and do things like that. So I still think that maybe, like I said, I sent this out in my email, if you read them, I've said many times, the district vice presidents need to be almost in charge and feed to the president.

Because I've suggested membership ideas. I don't know how many in the district, how many district vice presidents are doing it. I know years ago, we had a little contest at the number of the districts trying to recruit new members.

And at the November conference, we recognized the district that had gotten the most members. Now the members was not the number, like here you get eight and get one. It was proportional, it was the percentage.

And I've suggested that in about three emails. I don't know if anybody's ever read it. I didn't get an email, I tell you, from...

Well, no, you're not on the district vice presidents. Ah, you sent to district VP. Yeah, to the district vice presidents I've sent those ideas.

I think the thing, like you said, is really focused on 2026. Saturday, we have to have the students. Friday, Friday afternoon, they'll make it to the teacher.

[Sam] (1:23:14 - 1:24:03)
I think that especially the people in Albuquerque, because the conference is going to be probably somewhere in Albuquerque, they will come if it's promoted. I think the more we promote it, the more they'll come. But there has to be something to promote.

So, like Lori said, if it's just the students who won their districts, there's no reason for anybody else to come. I would say, since something like a workshop or a master class or a concert is what's going to bring a wider group of people, the more that we can get the judge to do. We can get somebody to give a concert Friday night, judge Saturday morning, and give a master class Saturday afternoon.

First of all, we can pay them more, it'll be worth the trip for them, and then we won't need to get anybody else to do it. And then we'll have something to promote, especially if it's somebody really good.

[Jeanne] (1:24:03 - 1:24:26)
Yeah, but you say you have them judging on Saturday? Yeah. You can't judge and do a presentation.

If you're going to judge, that goes all day. Not as well... Well, usually it's finished at four.

Well, yeah, but then you can't ask them to judge for six hours and then quickly do a 45-minute presentation on Shostakovich.

[Sam] (1:24:26 - 1:24:29)
No, they could do a master class. They don't have to prepare at all.

[Sharon] (1:24:34 - 1:24:35)
You have anybody in mind?

[Sam] (1:24:36 - 1:24:40)
I have lots of friends that could do this. I don't know if I can pay them enough to get them interested.

[Jeanne] (1:24:40 - 1:24:41)
Are they local?

[Sam] (1:24:42 - 1:24:47)
No, they'd be coming from far away. I think you have friends like that, too.

[Jeanne] (1:24:48 - 1:25:13)
Then you need to find someone who has bonus miles that they can donate for travel. Yeah, that's what Jackie McGee does. Even they bring in the judges from all over the country, and she has parents who will donate their hotel points so that she can put them up in the embassy suites for three nights or something like that.

It's usually six judges, because three for strings and three for piano.

[Sam] (1:25:14 - 1:25:17)
Okay, and vocal.

[Sharon] (1:25:18 - 1:25:18)
Yeah.

[Sam] (1:25:18 - 1:25:19)
Sometimes vocal as well.

[Sharon] (1:25:20 - 1:25:20)
Oh, yeah.

[Sam] (1:25:23 - 1:25:41)
But the more we can rely on a couple of people to do a lot of this themselves, I think it works out better numbers-wise, right? As far as paying fewer people more money than they can afford the trip.

[Jeanne] (1:25:42 - 1:25:51)
How about, as your district vice president, you check in with the president for AMTA, who is...

[Sam] (1:25:51 - 1:25:52)
Jackie.

[Jeanne] (1:25:52 - 1:26:10)
Jackie. And she should have some good ideas of the voice thing and see if... I don't think they would want to help us as such.

They pretty much have their own... They can share an idea and share. Yeah, that's what I mean, yeah.

[Sam] (1:26:10 - 1:26:15)
I think they'd love to see there be a conference that members would want to attend.

[Jeanne] (1:26:18 - 1:26:40)
Well, ask her. Yeah, I'm up for whatever works. Okay.

And if you all want to try to contact, try to get new members, have this little competition and see what district gets the most members.

[Speaker 7] (1:26:42 - 1:26:42)
Okay.

[Jeanne] (1:26:44 - 1:26:45)
We are trying, we are trying.

[Sam] (1:26:46 - 1:27:15)
Do we have... You mentioned that we should be asking people for money. Do we have a fundraising strategy?

Is there going to be anything coordinated about the way we do it? Honestly, since I haven't talked to any of you about this, I would feel uncomfortable just asking people for money on behalf of this organization, because I don't know what the overall strategy is. Do we have gold members, silver members, bronze members?

[Jeanne] (1:27:15 - 1:27:19)
We're not that category of donors yet.

[Sam] (1:27:20 - 1:27:26)
Well, it's just a name. You just set a number, and if you're above this number, then you get this designation.

[Jeanne] (1:27:26 - 1:28:24)
I think the first thing you have to have is a cause. Why do you want that person to make a contribution? And if you explain to the person that you need to bring in better judges or bringing in outstanding judges is very expensive, wouldn't you like to help us bring this person in?

Or if it's the person who's going to be giving a concert. Our goal is to raise $3,000 so we can bring in Joe Blow to play his tuba for us or something. We do always have to have some reason and some bottom line.

It's what we're trying to raise overall, but letting the person know any amount is helpful.

[Sam] (1:28:25 - 1:28:43)
Okay, but if I contact Burt Parnell, he gives a lot of money for music, and I say, Burt, we're looking to raise money so we can have judges. He says, that's a great idea, I'd like to do that. He gets a check, it goes to the treasury.

How do we know that's actually what's going to happen to it?

[Jeanne] (1:28:43 - 1:29:14)
It would go in the documents. We do keep track of things. We recognize those people.

But first of all, let's say if we think we want to have a specific cause, what are we going to have then for the conference? On Friday, we need a guest concert, a master class. The 75th anniversary is a wonderful reason to be raising funds.

[Sam] (1:29:15 - 1:29:19)
Could it just be for the conference? Maybe not so specific?

[Jeanne] (1:29:20 - 1:30:04)
It's never too early to start. 2026 is going to be here real soon. Usually your good concert or your master class and faculty and those people, they're booked out a year or two in advance.

For us right now to get somebody for 2025, I think maybe one of the faculty members that are from Eastern, they're new, I'd like to meet some of these people and I hear wonderful things about them, like Laurie was saying, and introduce the person to the community. Especially to the music community.

[Sam] (1:30:05 - 1:30:10)
Okay, well if she has any students at this thing and I end up doing it, I can meet her at least.

[Jeanne] (1:30:11 - 1:30:11)
Oh yeah.

[Sam] (1:30:12 - 1:30:16)
This is Bengoa? Yeah. Marina Bengoa.

[Jeanne] (1:30:17 - 1:30:24)
Anybody know her? No. Not yet.

Hopefully. I've had a lot of emails with her.

[Sam] (1:30:24 - 1:30:40)
If we're raising money to bring in specific people and we haven't decided who the specific people are yet, we can't ask. So if we had a general fund, you know, the operating account, if we're raising money for the treasury basically.

[Jeanne] (1:30:41 - 1:30:45)
Nobody is going to give you money for operations.

[Sam] (1:30:45 - 1:31:17)
Well, we can say this goes to planning the conference. This is for the conference, and we'll say what's going to be at the conference, but we need the money before we can get the people, so we shouldn't promise the people while we're asking for money. And we could also create an endowment.

What is this endowment? Is it Jane Snow or Janet Weed? Which one is the endowment?

Jane Snow. Is that a national endowment?

[Jeanne] (1:31:17 - 1:31:18)
No, it's local.

[Sam] (1:31:20 - 1:31:22)
So maybe we could raise money for that.

[Jeanne] (1:31:23 - 1:32:31)
I don't think you want to raise money for that because that money is designated to go directly to MT&A. It can't go anyplace else. We can't use any of that locally.

But I think it's too late to try to raise much money for 2025 because this is April and that's November. And summer vacation comes in between. But for the centennial, we need a handsome brochure that explains we've been around 75 years and this is what we've accomplished in that time and what we want to do.

And a little outline of our conference, what we'd like to do as our celebration. Not so much a conference as a celebration. It has to have a lot of bells and whistles to it.

[Sam] (1:32:32 - 1:32:38)
What would be involved in the celebration aspect of it that we wouldn't have at a normal conference?

[Jeanne] (1:32:38 - 1:34:01)
Well, that's what we have to plan. That's what Sharon was hoping the board would help her plan today. But for that, you can't just...

I shouldn't say can't. We can all ask our dentist to make a contribution. And I don't mind asking my dentist.

Wouldn't you like to make a contribution to this little organization for its 2025 conference? Because like every place else, we've felt the pinch. And chances are he'll say, okay, $75.

We can try the various banks where we have accounts. They may or may not. I would rather just focus on contributions for 2026.

If we want to make a big splash, bring in somebody, some high-profile pianist from California. Let me see, Indiana. There used to be a faculty member at Indiana.

He used to be here at UNM. I can't even think of her name now. Just think regional right now.

[Sam] (1:34:02 - 1:34:28)
So if we were to take the initiative and do a little fundraising on our own, we would ask whoever we're talking to to designate their contributions for either the general treasury or the 26th conference or possibly to go into a new endowment, if we can create a new endowment.

[Jeanne] (1:34:28 - 1:34:31)
Why would you want to create a new endowment?

[Sam] (1:34:32 - 1:34:42)
Well, we don't really have an old endowment. Why do you want to create an endowment? Because that ensures the long-term health of the organization.

[Jeanne] (1:34:42 - 1:34:55)
Are you going to make a yearly contribution then to the endowment? Usually it's somebody who has a big amount of funds that are willing to...

[Sam] (1:34:55 - 1:35:04)
But an endowment doesn't have to be contributed to every year. Everything grows on its own once it's started. That's why you have it.

[Jeanne] (1:35:05 - 1:35:11)
You can contribute money to our big event next year, Diamond Jewelry.

[Sam] (1:35:12 - 1:35:30)
That would be an option. So it's a question of we could give them these options. What do you want to contribute to?

But if they contribute to the endowment, then every year the endowment would make a contribution out of its interest to the treasury. So that would be an automatic contribution.

[Jeanne] (1:35:30 - 1:35:32)
How big of an endowment do you envision?

[Sam] (1:35:35 - 1:35:36)
The bigger the better.

[Chip] (1:35:38 - 1:35:41)
And if it exists, can't people contribute to it constantly?

[Sam] (1:35:41 - 1:35:42)
Anytime they want to, yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:35:42 - 1:36:21)
Well, that's what we already have, some funds. So just contribute to them. The banks will probably charge you a fee if it's too small.

You have to have a certain amount. And if you're a business, I don't know about non-profits, but a business will charge you extra fees as opposed to a personal account. We've got to move along here, though, because we need to...



[Sharon] (1:36:21 - 1:36:24)
Do we have nominations for the Teacher of the Year?

[Jeanne] (1:36:26 - 1:36:39)
But I saw... Did Larry Blind, was he a Teacher of the Year in the past years?

And we have his... Larry Blind. He has been a teacher.

[Speaker 7] (1:36:39 - 1:36:39)
Has he been?

[Jeanne] (1:36:40 - 1:38:20)
Okay. It's on that list. Let's change to the list.

Yes, it is. Do you know when he was a Teacher of the Year? Was the year before or after you?

The year before. Pardon? Before me?

Mm-hmm. Madeleine Williamson was old in 2019. Oh, no.

Before me. Oh, this one. In 2021.

In 2021? Yes, it was... I don't remember what happened in the last year.

Lower documents. Thank you. This is for...

Young Indians can say by name. And, yeah, in 2021. Think about it.

Okay, I need to... I can actually try to check it, yeah. I don't know this lady very well.

She was older, but I remember she was nominated. Yeah, we need to know who... Because in 2020, there was no award made.

In 2019, it was Madeleine Williamson. In 2024, it was Tatiana Bee. And she still has her plaque.

In 2023, it was Tatiana Bee. In 2022, it was you. They're all listed in the back of the directory.

From the beginning of time, they're listed in the back of the directory? Except the ones that are here. This is an old directory.

ICF-21, 22. Yeah.

[Chip] (1:38:21 - 1:38:23)
You replied to it in October.

[Jeanne] (1:38:24 - 1:38:25)
Well, that was last year.

[Chip] (1:38:25 - 1:38:29)
It's October of 2024. That's the teacher of the year nomination.

[Jeanne] (1:38:29 - 1:38:31)
But that was for last year.

[Chip] (1:38:32 - 1:38:36)
It says 2025, teacher of the year nomination.

[Sharon] (1:38:36 - 1:38:37)
And then it should...

[Jeanne] (1:38:37 - 1:38:42)
What are the responses to it?

[Sharon] (1:38:49 - 1:39:17)
Farrell was 2010.

2012 was Rebecca Carone. 2013, no award made. 2014, Heather Nassi.

2015, Diane Brower-Bailey, who has passed away. 2016, Doris Tangersud, who has passed away. 2017, no award made.

Okay, to Teri Resch.

[Jeanne] (1:39:17 - 1:39:30)
I believe the reason Teri Resch was not nominated last time was she has not contributed very much to community service. Okay.



[Janna] (1:39:32 - 1:39:33)
But she's a good contributor.

[Chip] (1:39:36 - 1:39:46)
She taught such a wonderful workshop at the conference last year. At the 2023 conference, she did the bowl with the children.

[Sharon] (1:39:47 - 1:39:49)
She did it for a while, the student activities.

[Chip] (1:39:49 - 1:40:01)
She was a chair. 2023. Yeah, she did it for a while.

She also made things to sell, to raise money for the organization. She's contributed quite a lot.

[Sharon] (1:40:02 - 1:40:05)
Do you want to make a motion right now?

[Chip] (1:40:05 - 1:40:07)
I would like to make a motion for Teri Resch.

[Jeanne] (1:40:07 - 1:40:08)
To be what?

[Chip] (1:40:08 - 1:40:09)
Teacher of the Year.

[Jeanne] (1:40:09 - 1:40:11)
Teacher of the Year for 2025.

[Chip] (1:40:12 - 1:40:12)
That's correct.

[Sharon] (1:40:12 - 1:40:19)
And then can you submit as written... We'll vote now, but then submit as written documentation.

[Chip] (1:40:19 - 1:40:23)
I've already done that. It's in your email and it's in Gene's email.

[Sharon] (1:40:24 - 1:40:25)
As of now?

[Jeanne] (1:40:25 - 1:40:27)
That was last year.

[Chip] (1:40:28 - 1:40:29)
It's in your email.

[Sharon] (1:40:29 - 1:40:30)
Well, if it wasn't...

[Chip] (1:40:30 - 1:40:32)
Right now, I just sent it. You just sent it now.

[Sharon] (1:40:33 - 1:40:33)
Okay.

[Chip] (1:40:33 - 1:40:37)
Thank you. I did, I just sent it.

[Sharon] (1:40:37 - 1:40:38)
Alright, well now we will have a vote.

[Jeanne] (1:40:39 - 1:40:42)
Don't you think we all have to look at the recommendation and then vote?

[Sharon] (1:40:42 - 1:40:42)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:40:43 - 1:40:46)
We can vote by email. That's how we did last year.

[Sharon] (1:40:46 - 1:40:47)
Is that how we did last year?



[Janna] (1:40:47 - 1:40:50)
Laurie, do you hear? You see, so just Teri Resch.

[Lori] (1:40:51 - 1:40:53)
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

[Janna] (1:40:53 - 1:40:54)
Good idea.

[Lori] (1:40:54 - 1:40:56)
I second it.



[Janna] (1:40:57 - 1:40:57)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:41:01 - 1:41:03)
And vote for...

[Sharon] (1:41:05 - 1:41:08)
Do you have paper ready to read or something?

[Chip] (1:41:08 - 1:41:11)
Yes, ma'am.

[Sharon] (1:41:15 - 1:41:17)
Yeah, let's get this done now.

[Chip] (1:41:18 - 1:41:20)
Would you like me to read it?

[Sharon] (1:41:20 - 1:41:20)
Yes, please.

[Jeanne] (1:41:20 - 1:41:21)
Or would you like to read it? No, read it.

[Chip] (1:41:21 - 1:42:27)
Here is the form. The first part says, date and place of birth. She's married to Fred Sturm, who is a pianist and piano technician.

They met in piano technician school. They have two children and one granddaughter. There's an attachment for her education, teaching experience, Interlochen School for the Arts, 2021, DFW Wow!

Also a guest lecturer in Baroque performance practice, UNM 2019-2021, UNM Music Prep School Delpros Classes 2021, the Flute Fiesta.

There's a couple of pages here.

[Sharon] (1:42:28 - 1:42:30)
What has she done for PMTNM?

[Chip] (1:42:30 - 1:42:42)
Students entered in the AMTA student recitals, PEP, state, local, and honors MTNA senior competition, local and regional.

[Jeanne] (1:42:43 - 1:43:01)
She did music ball at conference. Students ball, music ball for a few years. It started before pandemic.

She did good job. And I remember when you have conference before pandemic, she was very great attendance. A couple of my students came here.

[Chip] (1:43:02 - 1:44:08)
She's hosted the AMTA Music Book Discussion Group, active member of PMTNM since 1995. She attends to state conferences, board meetings, and participates in events and programs for student teachers and sponsored by PMTNM. She's the central district vice president for PMTNM from 2008.

She was co-chair of student recital programs, 97 to 2001, 2007 to 10. She was PMTNM state conference chair committee member, 2009. AMTA co-chair of scale and theory program, 2001 to 2005.

There's a few more bullet points. She was a scholarship committee member for a couple of years, board member of the Friends of Music, who reaches scholarship funds for UNM students. She judged the PMTNM scale and theory program at the local and state levels, judged the National Federation of Music Club Festival, volunteer music teacher for arts and schools, and parent volunteer for bringing music to APS classrooms.

[Jeanne] (1:44:09 - 1:44:32)
Okay, thank you. So that'll be printed off then and have it in our documentation. Do you find it, Gene?

Nothing has come through. The last thing I have from you is, welcome to the board meeting. This is about the Zoom.

Nothing has come through yet for the email.

[Chip] (1:44:34 - 1:44:43)
So I just sent Gene a copy, and now you both have that in your emails. I thought that was your phone right there. There you go.

[Jeanne] (1:44:47 - 1:45:23)
Nope, the last thing I have in email came from the Atlantic Monthly. You just need to update sometimes. Okay, so we have a nomination for Terry Reck with the documentation, and the nomination read.

Any further nominations? Could it be, just a question, could it be a person nominated twice or not, just once? I think we'd just do it once.

Once, okay. No, just check. Because she's asking about Farrell.

Oh, oh, no, he's already been. I know, but could he be again if something, just asking. Oh, yeah, no.

[Sharon] (1:45:23 - 1:45:24)
No, just once?

[Jeanne] (1:45:24 - 1:48:46)
Yeah, I think once. We have lots of people who really deserve it. No, I just, yeah, just check.

All those, let's have a nomination and complete this. I've got other things. All those in favor, say aye.

Aye. Opposed? Okay.

Now, Terry Reck is our 2025 Teacher of the Year. Did you want to send her an email, Gene, or do you want me to? I think it would be nice if it came from the President.

Okay. I'm willing to do it. Yeah, no, no, I will.

Yeah. Okay, that is completed. 

[sharon]
Okay, also for the directory, we've had information, people asking for a new directory.
And I think we have the funds, don't we, where we could afford to have a directory, Gene? The directory's not so expensive to print. It is expensive to mail.


So, I mean, it would be a matter of taking a sample to the post office and ask them now what the postage would be. 

[Jeanne]
But it was something like 90 cents the last time we mailed them out. And postage has gone up.

[Sharon]
Yeah. Maybe we can keep it. I'm sorry.

[Jeanne]
No, maybe we can, you can just keep it for conference and we can pick it up. We don't have to send it. Then it would be out of date.

No, in November. Is there an online directory? Well, supposedly, the equivalent of the directory is on the website.

I have no luck with it, and I find MT&A people. And it's true, some people have asked for a printed directory. They like having it in hand, and I understand that.

But I'm lucky, Pierre, who gets to put it together. At this point, memberships are beginning to renew for next year. So in preparing the printed directory in the past, we've waited until about December to put everything together, because then we have a pretty accurate record of who's going to join.

Because if you print it too soon, you leave out people. 

[sharon]

Right, right. And then you have to send out an addendum.


[jeanne]
So in November, we can have kind of, you will know better, and we can pick it up. Or, Ivanov's suggestion, you can, for example, to Santa Fe, you don't need to send everyone. You can just send it to me, and we'll distribute it.

And just give them personally, and it's all safe for postage. Like in Los Alamos, send it to Wendy and she'll... 

[sharon] 
So you're saying, have the directory ready by the 9th of November?

[jeanne]
Well, actually, by then, most of the members would be in. Will that be the time to distribute it? It is, but it's a question of getting it.

It takes time to put it together, the formatting.

[Sam] (1:48:49 - 1:48:54)
I understand. Who maintains the online directory?

[Chip] (1:48:54 - 1:48:55)
MT&A.

[Sam] (1:48:55 - 1:48:58)
Who maintains the online directory?

[Jeanne] (1:48:58 - 1:49:28)
MT&A does not maintain our online directory. MT&A is the online... MT&A has all our information, but they don't have what's in our directory.

Our directory has a list of all our past presidents, all our past Teachers of the Year, our Code of Ethics. There's more in there than just a list of members, which is what MT&A has.

[Sam] (1:49:28 - 1:49:35)
But when people request a hard copy, they're looking for everybody's phone number, basically, right? E-mail.

[Jeanne] (1:49:36 - 1:50:03)
For example, if I'm talking on the phone to somebody and they'll say, I'm moving and is there a teacher there in Las Cruces? Well, you can tell them to go look on that. But if it's at the moment, I always have mine right over there on my desk, and so if I need to find something, or a teacher here in Albuquerque.

Right. Who live in Bartalas? When I start to search for...

Okay, I see. Who live in Bartalas? They say Bartalas.

Who live in Bartalas?

[Sharon] (1:50:03 - 1:50:04)
Well, we'll just hire it.

[Jeanne] (1:50:04 - 1:50:29)
Our printed directory, Sam, also has all the teachers in Albuquerque. It has teachers by town and community. And districts.

Albuquerque is in the districts. And MT&A could call that up for you, but that's not MT&A's business. They're running the national...

I mean, nationally, who's a member.

[Sam] (1:50:29 - 1:50:32)
And how much of that information is on the online directory?

[Jeanne] (1:50:34 - 1:50:39)
The online directory, when the website is functioning well, it's all there.

[Sam] (1:50:40 - 1:50:50)
Okay. And there's probably not too many people who need a hard copy, but if there are a few, sending it to just the ones who request it would not be expensive.

[Jeanne] (1:50:53 - 1:51:12)
It's a question of, is it worth going to the trouble to do that for five or six people? Because it is time-consuming to put this together. Definitely.

[janna]
I'm sorry, I need to leave. I have teaching. Oh, okay.

I'm driving one hour. Oh, yes, yes. Well, thank you.

[Chip] (1:51:12 - 1:51:14)
Thank you for coming all the way down.

[Jeanne] (1:51:14 - 1:51:36)
I think you have... It's good to see you. Thank you.

So we've taken care... We kind of already have alluded to the new business of the conferences, and we... Anything I need to...

Oh. No? No.

We might pass on... Well, I'm sure Wendy's been on there to hear...

[Sharon] (1:51:36 - 1:51:37)
No, no.

[Jeanne] (1:51:37 - 1:51:39)
We will. Tomorrow we have a meeting in Los Alamos.

[Sharon] (1:51:39 - 1:51:40)
Oh, good. You can pass... Not tomorrow.

Sunday.

[Jeanne] (1:51:41 - 1:51:45)
Oh, good. So you can pass on that. Sunday we have a meeting in Los Alamos, and then we can...

[Sharon] (1:51:45 - 1:51:45)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:51:45 - 1:51:46)
Oh, that's wonderful.

[Sharon] (1:51:46 - 1:51:47)
Yeah, yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:51:47 - 1:51:48)
Definitely we will talk about it.

[Sharon] (1:51:48 - 1:51:48)
Yeah.

[Jeanne] (1:51:49 - 1:51:51)
So, no, I just said anything else that I need to...

[Sharon] (1:51:51 - 1:51:52)
Yeah, no, not really.

[Jeanne] (1:51:52 - 1:52:34)
No, I think we've covered a lot of things. Do you need a paper clip? Oh, it's...

Oh, thank you. Yeah. So it's thank you very much.

It was nice to see you, and nice to meet you in person. Face-to-face. And thank you so much for coming down.

Yes, we did. Thank you. Okay, I definitely will see you at conference, even if I don't have to...

Well, you always do come. I try to come. I try to.

It's community, like Chip said. We have to be a community, right? We have to...

We need more of you. You're so sweet. Thank you very much.

Sorry I was maybe a little weak communicating, but teacher ask me, you know. They can find, they can find, they can find.

[Chip] (1:52:34 - 1:52:35)
We did it.

[Jeanne] (1:52:36 - 1:52:38)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 7] (1:52:38 - 1:52:39)
Drive safe.

[Chip] (1:52:40 - 1:52:40)
Drive safe.

[Speaker 7] (1:52:40 - 1:52:43)
Okay. No wait for you. Okay.

All right.

[Jeanne] (1:52:44 - 1:52:50)
So, any further new business? I think I've covered everything. Any old business?

[Sam] (1:52:53 - 1:52:54)
What is the old business?

[Jeanne] (1:52:54 - 1:53:03)
Well, something from the past that... Like I said, we really haven't had a decent meeting in two years. And that's all.

[Sam] (1:53:04 - 1:53:05)
So there is no old business.

[Jeanne] (1:53:05 - 1:53:15)
I guess not. Okay, we've asked. Okay, then there's no further business.

A motion that the meeting be adjourned?

[Sam] (1:53:16 - 1:53:17)
Seconded.

[Jeanne] (1:53:18 - 1:53:26)
I've been told that you don't even have to ask. You just say the meeting is adjourned. It is.
