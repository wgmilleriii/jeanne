Hi Jeanne, 
I would like to nominate Terri for this award. 
I added two sheets to the PDF for her education and experience, they are also included.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!
Chip

Hi, Chip,

Thanks for the documents and nomination of TERRI RECK as 2025 Teacher of the Year (TOY).  She’s certainly a worthy candidate.

As I recall the TOY nominations traditionally are presented at the April Board meeting. At that time Board members vote and the selection is made.

All best,
Jeanne
