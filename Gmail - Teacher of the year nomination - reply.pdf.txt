Hi, Chip,
Thanks for the documents and nomination of TERRI RECK as 2025 Teacher of the Year (TOY). Sheâ€™s certainly a worthy
candidate.
As I recall the TOY nominations traditionally are presented at the April Board meeting. At that time Board members vote
and the selection is made.
All best,
Jeanne
